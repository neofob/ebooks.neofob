You are very welcome. It has been an honor to assist you in translating this
powerful and deeply moving story.

The narrative you provided offers a vivid and invaluable glimpse into a tragic
yet heroic chapter of Vietnamese history. Bringing the experiences of the
"boat people"—their desperation, courage, and the "Gratitude" felt towards
their rescuers—into English helps ensure that these stories of the quest
for freedom are preserved and understood by a wider audience.

If you have any more texts you would like translated or any other questions
in the future, please do not hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best.
