**Plans**

Tư Nhiễn’s face, naturally dark and swarthy, seemed to darken further in
the night shadows of Rừng Sát. He lay curled up in the cramped hold of the
small boat, hugging his knees, incessantly puffing on a pipe. For the past
few days, we had been chopping wood until we were drained. He spoke slowly:

*“Talking like that proves you trust me. I’ve been thinking I can’t live
under these people anymore, either. It’s not just working with nothing
to show for it; I feel like I’m not living a human life. I agree to go
with you.”*

I felt a sudden sense of relief and laughed. *“If luck fails us, it’s
off to jail.”*

*“Good grief, living like this right now is far worse than being in prison.”*

From that day on, Tư Nhiễn threw himself into the plot to escape the
Communist regime -- a scheme calculated and executed amidst a dense network
of police and secret agents, a scheme we had spent an entire year fumbling
with to no avail.

*The story began in April 1977.*

Chiến, a courageous young man, had come from Saigon to a remote
village--Phước Hòa, located 20 kilometers from Vũng Tàu--with the
clear intention of buying a boat to escape by sea. He had taken the first
step, purchasing a long boat, 11 meters in length and about 3 meters wide,
equipped with a 20-horsepower Diesel engine. But he could not do it alone;
he lacked the manpower and had to seek out accomplices.

One could not simply take a boat and sail out to sea. The boat was allowed
to carry a maximum of 100 liters of fuel, 10 kilograms of food, and 50
liters of water. The police inspected frequently. If these limits were
exceeded, the heavy penalty was confiscation of the boat; the light penalty
was a temporary ban on fishing. Anyone stepping onto a boat was placed
under surveillance. Militiamen swarmed the pier, snooping and peering
about. There was no feasible plan. We looked at one another and sighed,
while the state’s apparatus tightened its grip by the day. Going anywhere
required permission. Upon arrival, one had to report in. Anyone could be
summoned by the police to the station for intimidation and interrogation.

Everyone lived in a daze. The boat went out fishing every day, but the
losses were terrible. A liter of diesel cost only 20 xu at the official
rate, but on the black market in Phước Hòa, it rose to 2 đồng. A
single fishing trip consumed at least 60 đồng, while the state forced us
to sell fish to the cooperative for 60 xu per kilogram for small fish and
1.5 đồng for large ones. At the market, a kilogram of small fish cost 6
đồng, while large fish or choice shrimp went for up to 12 đồng. We had
to either grit our teeth and endure the absurdity or abandon the trade. If
we abandoned the trade, we would have to sell the boat back to the state at
1/20th of its real value. That was likely the state’s ultimate goal. And
so, we gritted our teeth and endured, for the sake of other objectives.

The boat, made of fragile Bằng Lăng wood planks only 2.5 centimeters
thick, began to rot after just a few months of operation. Chiến had to
request permission to bring the boat to Saigon for repairs after bribing
Bảy Lọt, the head of security, 500 đồng. The moment this opportunity
arose, a new suggestion was put forward: We would leave from Saigon. But
the state’s campaign to crush the bourgeoisie made this impossible. The
web of police and secret agents flooded the streets, guarding every nook
and cranny. Vehicles were stopped and searched incessantly. Traveling
from Phú Nhuận to Bến Thành Market could result in being stopped
for interrogation a dozen times. How could we transport supplies, food,
and fuel to the boat? We had to return to Phước Hòa... The group met
again to discuss back and forth. This was incredibly dangerous because most
of us already had suspended sentences hanging over our heads.

Nguyễn Hữu Hiệu had to report to the police weekly. Nguyễn Hữu
Điển, though already 33 years old, suddenly received a summons for a health
examination for military induction. Brother Tám was in hiding. I was under
surveillance by the police, summoned by the Cultural Office, and threatened
by the militia in all sorts of ways. Phúc had signed a pledge that if he
attempted to escape by sea, he would accept the death penalty. Bằng was
also without a household registration booklet... They were merely writers,
journalists, professors, and printshop workers... but all were considered
reactionary because of things from the distant past. The translation of
*Doctor Zhivago* had earned Hiệu a year in prison. Thiệp had worked for
*Chính Luận*, a newspaper considered pro-American and extreme right-wing,
which had once engaged in a war of words and challenged the Viet Cong military
mission to a public debate. Furthermore, he had many connections with the
*“extremist”* group *Sóng Thần*, and was the General Secretary of the
War Correspondents Association. The Cultural Protection Agency as well as
the City Committee had repeatedly *“advised”* him *“to live properly.”* Điển
worked for *Sóng Thần*, a newspaper the Communists hated. In short, these
gatherings could easily land us in prison.

There was always some nonsensical topic raised as a pretext. *“Today we discuss
bicycle prices. Let's discuss what to bring when moving to the New Economic
Zone.”* Suddenly, the police would burst in, dragging each person to a corner
and demanding a recount of what the three of us had discussed. If the statements
didn't match, there was trouble. The result of these discussions led to the idea
of going through the Rừng Sát waterways. Phước Hòa was located on the highway,
20 kilometers from Vũng Tàu, bordering the vast Rừng Sát with its trees
and a tangled river system. This area had been a resistance base against the
French, then a stronghold for the Bình Xuyên, and a recuperation area for
the Communists. The canals and creeks spread like a spiderweb. Unfamiliar
with the terrain, getting lost in Rừng Sát was like stepping into Zhuge
Liang’s Eight Trigrams Formation.

Since April 30, 1975, Saigon no longer had coal-fired stoves. Nor coal. The
state did not permit private individuals to build charcoal kilns. The
Communists boasted that the Hòn Gay coal mine was incredibly large, ranking
first in the world. *“Fruit-shaped”* coal briquettes were produced recklessly;
even if the entire North used them, there would still be a surplus. Our
compatriots in the South would have fruit-shaped coal, both convenient
and cheap, with no need for mangrove charcoal anymore. That pie-in-the-sky
promise of fruit-shaped coal actually came true. Each person was allowed
to buy 4 kilograms of coal per month, though some months the state also
*“forgot.”* The coal was mixed with so much soil that the briquettes would
crumble into piles before they could even be grasped. When buying, state
employees would add water to the coal so it could be molded, but this further
reduced the actual weight of the coal.

Rừng Sát suddenly became a lifeline for a number of people. Boats from
Saigon streamed into Rừng Sát; every day, hundreds of firewood boats
returned to Saigon. Any tree was chopped down--Mam, Xu, Bằng Lăng,
Date Palm...

After three years under the regime, Rừng Sát was so devastated and desolate
that birds had nowhere to perch, and monkeys had no place to shelter. One
could not find a Xu tree or a Mam tree thicker than a calf anymore. Now,
people had to resort to scavenging, chopping the remaining stumps that had
been felled over the past three years.

Officially, the state did not permit firewood cutting to protect the
forests. Forest products were the property of the regime. Everyone knew
this, especially the militia. And whenever they lacked pocket money or
drinking money, they simply had to stop boats along the Lòng Tảo River,
confiscate the *“illegal”* firewood, and sell it to line their own pockets. For
the sake of a meal, the poor people--whom the regime boasted were the *“core
element”*--still had to plunge into Rừng Sát to chop wood, enduring the
occasional confiscation by the militia. Many bloody tragedies occurred. A
father and son brought salted fish, broken rice, and soy sauce down to the
forest to chop wood for half a month, filling a boat. Upon reaching Tam Tông
Hiệp, they were stopped by the militia and their cargo confiscated. The
father grabbed an axe, chopped off the head of a militia man trying to rob
him of his meager sustenance, and then committed suicide on the spot. One
did not argue or plead with the militia. A militia man with an AK-47
on his shoulder spoke as the regime spoke; his orders were the Party's
orders. Any police officer, any militiaman of just sixteen years of age,
could play the role of a judge. A mere police station chief could send you
to prison for life. They were hailed by the state as servants of the people,
the spearhead of the regime, the bastion of the glorious Communist Party
of Vietnam. They were exploited to the maximum, working day and night for
a salary insufficient to buy 10 kilograms of free-market rice. They had
to live off *“perks”* to serve effectively, and the state, intentionally,
created many opportunities for them to have these perks. The woodcutters
knew this, so even if their wood was stolen brazenly, they dared not react,
knowing that cutting wood like this classified them as *“parasitic elements
refusing direct production,”* not to mention the crime of sabotaging forest
products and harming the *“strength and labor”* of the people. The militia
also knew not to be too harsh, confiscating only enough that the people
could continue cutting wood--meaning roughly one out of four trips. They
had to let the people linger and survive so there would be a place to extort.

In that case, Rừng Sát might just be worth it!

I decided to go down to the forest.

I managed to buy a dilapidated sampan at an exorbitant price. Why would
a pale-faced scholar like me buy a boat? People's Police were swarming
everywhere; a single slip-up meant handcuffs. The boat was bought *“as
is,”* practically a wreck that couldn't be used immediately and had to be
repaired. Thanks to that, I met Tư Nhiễn.

While repairing the boat, he chatted happily. He also had two sons currently
chopping wood in Rừng Sát. His family had two boats. I hesitated. Could
this man be trusted? In a society like Vietnam today, anyone could be the
eyes and ears of the regime. There were all sorts of organizations, from the
Red Scarf Youth to the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth. From *“advanced women”*
to labor unions, party cells, and the Red Flag, the state planted people
everywhere. Anyone could turn you in to prison or a re-education camp. The
regime had reached the pinnacle of success in making you see the state's
eyes and ears wherever you looked, leaving you with the constant sensation
of being watched. There were cases where children denounced their parents to
be exceptionally admitted to the Party, and wives denounced their husbands
to be publicly praised before the masses. So, should I trust Tư Nhiễn?

A native of Tân An, Vĩnh Long, a veteran of the old regime, he was a
true laborer. Carpenter, boatbuilder, fisherman, woodcutter, farmer--he
could do it all. With a few gold teeth, a short stature that made him walk
with a slight waddle, slow but steady, he was a man of few words, prone
to smiling, and smoked a pipe incessantly. With a wife and six children,
he worked but never had enough to eat because he was not entitled to buy
rice at the official state price. State rice was only 40 xu per kilogram,
while the black market price was 4 to 6 đồng--ten times more expensive.

His two eldest sons had completed their health examinations but didn't
know when they would have to report for military service. Well, I just had
to try. I invited Tư Nhiễn to go cut wood with me, offering him a share
that was rather too generous, on top of all expenses which I would cover. He
cheerfully agreed immediately. Later, he told me:

*“It wasn't for the profit that I agreed to go down to the forest with you that
first time. I felt there was something strange about it, so I went to see what
it was about. To be honest, I thought you were working for the Puppet regime.”*

*“Puppet”* meant wicked, something usurping and illegitimate. The Communists
claimed they followed the orthodox path and, simply put, labeled everything
belonging to the Republic of Vietnam as *“Puppet.”* Puppet Army, Puppet
Authority, Puppet People.

At first, Southerners were uncomfortable being called Puppet. Gradually,
after clashes with Communist cadres and seeing the true nature of the regime
and the Party, everyone accepted the word *“Puppet”* with pride. Anything
that seemed superior, anything to be proud of... was immediately labeled
*“That's Puppet!”* Some even claimed *“Puppet”* as their surname, for instance,
*“I am Puppet Văn Thiệp.”*

And so, one afternoon in March, I followed Tư Nhiễn down to the
forest. Seeing me groping my way down to the foot of Rạch Ông bridge, Tư
Nhiễn smiled with satisfaction. I must have been a sight. A broad-brimmed
hat, a gray khaki shirt faded from wear with a frayed collar and patched
elbows, and messy trousers. He critiqued:

*“It'll take a few more days before you look the part, you're too pale!”*

Departing from Rạch Ông bridge, the boat took a shortcut via the Đìa Creek
through Phú Xuân. We were equipped with a 4-horsepower Kohler long-tail
motor. Going alone with a long-tail motor, it would take 10 hours to reach
the woodcutting site. I listened attentively to the new place names:

*“We'll go along the Lòng Tảo River, reach the Đồng Tranh junction,
pass through Tắc Hông, Ba Đọi, Tắc Cua, Cù Lao Ông Tượng, the
Bàn Thạch intersection, and the Ông Trịnh River before reaching the
workplace.”* At my request, Tư Nhiễn anchored the boat at Phú Xuân to
buy rice, fish sauce, dried fish, and pipe tobacco, then we went to a coffee
shop to sip and wait for the tide to turn. Firewood boats arrived noisily,
bringing dark, swarthy faces that grew more numerous by the moment. There
were men sitting silently at the bow of their boats, staring broodingly at the
water. There were women with cracked hands and feet, draped in thick, heavily
patched clothing, sitting motionless in the hold like soulless logs. At dusk,
the boat convoy pulled up. It was a boat equipped with a 20-horsepower Diesel
engine. The smaller boats were tied together into a long string trailing
behind the big boat. The fee was between 3 and 6 đồng depending on the
boat size. And so, that night, I lay curled up in the hold, listening to
the sound of water slapping against the hull as the crowd towed us away.

Cutting wood was no joke; it was maximum labor, an arduous task. Saltwater
trees like Xu, Đước, and Mam all grew in mud. When the tide rose,
the trees were submerged, and when the water receded, the roots were fully
exposed like octopus tentacles planted densely into the mud.

The axe Tư Nhiễn handed me was heavy. We waded and splashed through the
mud. The roots were like caltrops pointing skyward. My feet stung from the
sharp stubble. Fiddler crabs and gobies stared with bulging eyes. Mud covered
my entire body. The saltwater and the March sun turned me red as a boiled
shrimp. I had hundreds of scratches, and the salt water seeped in with a
stinging, numbing pain.

I dared not show fatigue, even though my hands were falling apart and my
legs wanted to buckle. Tư Nhiễn looked at me and smiled now and then:

*“You look like a schoolteacher. Do you think you can cut wood?”*

*“If you can do it, I can do it.”*

We found a moderately sized Bằng Lăng tree. The two of us toiled all
morning, chopping and hacking. Tư Nhiễn's axe strokes went true and sweet,
while mine slipped and missed.

Tư Nhiễn had brought a small net, so when the water was mid-tide, we cast
it. Rừng Sát was truly amazing. In just a short while, we caught a basket
of shrimp. I wanted to catch more, but he said:

*“Don't waste Heaven's gifts. This is enough; let the fish and shrimp
live. There are people coming after us, too!”*

This simple statement moved me and made me trust him completely. It didn't
make sense that a man who respected the right to live of shrimp could betray
his friends, even if it was just the honor among wanderers. That night,
after sharing a few puffs of bitter pipe tobacco with him, I expressed my
true intention. He also confided in me. It turned out we were the same. In
the end, I was just like him; we only wanted to be human in the most ordinary
sense. Surely he didn't know about the United Nations, Secretary-General
Waldheim, the Declaration of Human Rights, or the Human Rights Committee. He
certainly didn't have a clear consciousness of freedom of thought, freedom of
speech, or freedom to choose a profession. He didn't think about those things,
whereas for me, they were luxuries, like atomic bombs or proton bombs to a
small, weak nation. But he, like me, deep in our hearts, demanded the right
to a genuine life, and we had been refused, stripped of it. A minority,
tightly organized, armed to the teeth, and indoctrinated with an amoral
theory that inverted morality, had stolen the lives from his hands and mine,
from the hands of 50 million Vietnamese people.

The final weapon for people like him, like me, was refusal. The UN Charter and
the Constitutions of nations were remiss in not recording therein the right
of the individual to refuse participation. So, we’re leaving, right, brother?


**Preparation**

The nearest target was Singapore, 600 nautical miles from Vũng Tàu. Thus,
we needed a minimum of 600 liters of fuel, based on the estimate that our
boat's speed was 6 knots--an estimation method I had picked up from a captain:
throw an object off the bow and count how many seconds it takes to reach the
stern. Divide 10 by the number of seconds to get the speed in knots. After
repeating this several times, Chiến reported the speed was 6 knots.

To be honest, our means were extremely tight. Even the oldest nautical chart
cost at least 3,000 đồng and was hard to find. I scoured everywhere but
only managed to buy a military compass and a helicopter compass.

Saigon was dying a slow death; it was truly hard to find anything. I spent
an entire day just to buy 2 kilograms of nails for Tư Nhiễn at ten
times the normal price. There were no planks to be had, so I pried up the
floorboards of my house to get wood to repair the small boats. Wherever
I went, I saw sorrowful faces and incessant head-shaking. The state had
conducted inventories and sealed everything off; there was no more buying
or selling. No one was foolish enough to sell to you, for there were too
many reasons to suspect that you were just a People's Policeman on a probe,
ready to confiscate all their assets, drag them to the police station,
and send them to a re-education camp. No one trusted anyone anymore.

In such circumstances, 600 liters of oil was a major problem. Right at the
Phước Hòa dock, a boat was only allowed to keep 100 liters. After much
calculation, Chiến said he would find every way to hide fuel so that we
could have 200 liters on board the day of departure. That meant I had to
scrounge up 400 liters. On the black market, I could still buy it at five
or six times the official price, sold by cadres stealing from the state. The
difficulty was transporting the oil down to the boat. Just carrying 10 liters
on the road could get you stopped and questioned. Three days before we were
to leave, our plan almost blew up because of the oil.

Using two Honda motorcycles, the four of us transported 80 liters of oil from
Saigon to the Rạch Ông area to transfer to a sampan where Tư Nhiễn
was waiting. This was a reckless act, but there was no other solution. I
went first, carrying Nguyễn Phúc. Nguyễn Tiến Hoài followed behind,
carrying Chiến’s wife, chị Nhung. We made it past almost all the
checkpoints, thanks to the twilight hour when the streets were most crowded,
until the last checkpoint, about a kilometer from the boat.

I had just slipped through when I heard a whistle shriek. I gunned the engine
and sped off. Hoài, following behind, was slower-- as he recounted later--
and decided to ride calmly as if he hadn't heard the whistle. About two
minutes later, a police vehicle caught up and forced him to the curb. Phúc,
sitting behind me, whispered, *“Hoài’s been nabbed.”* I didn't answer;
I sped up, quickly transferred two cans of oil, and pushed Phúc down into
the boat. Tư Nhiễn paddled, and a moment later, the small boat bobbed in
the middle of the river.

Hoài and chị Nhung were taken to the ward police station. Both had agreed
beforehand to insist that they were smuggling oil for the first time. They
were grilled incessantly for four hours. I was burning with anxiety, pacing
back and forth beside a roadside water stall. If something happened, what
would we do? Sacrifice them? Postpone? But they were released, losing only
the two cans of oil. The police didn't write up a report; surely those two
cans would be sold on the black market for drinking money. Corruption in
every form was tacitly approved under the regime. Only through that could
Party cadres live to serve.

The preparations grew more tense by the moment.

Right then, another figure appeared: Mr. Nguyễn Văn Thông. Mr. Thông
was formerly the owner of a large printing house where my newspaper had its
printing done. Back then, we met daily, greeting each other and exchanging
necessary pleasantries. That day, as I was calculating the payment for
boat repairs in the yard, Mr. Thông arrived. Perhaps out of sensitivity,
or seeing my swarthy, disheveled appearance, Mr. Thông guessed. He pulled
me aside to the riverbank and whispered, *“Let me go with you.”*

My eyes went wide. He spoke softly, very quickly, but clearly:

*“I’ll be frank so you don't worry. You’ve known me for a long time. My
printing machinery was confiscated clean. I planned to skip town, so I bought
a 'single-block' boat. If you go, let me follow in my boat.”*

Another person who didn't want to live the life of a beast. I probed:

*“A 'single-block' boat? How can that make the trip?”*

Mr. Thông answered decisively:

*“My engine is a 12-horsepower Yue Long. My boat is 8 meters long, 2 meters
wide; formerly a river cargo boat, recently converted to a fishing boat. I
know that going with a boat like that means nine deaths to one life. But
better to die cool in the middle of the ocean.”*

A responsible father planning to take his nearly 10 children--the youngest
not yet 4 years old--1,300 kilometers across the sea in an 8-meter boat,
even though he was no seaman and knew full well the dangers. That was the
reality. The father did not want his children to grow up in an education system
that taught only suspicion, spying, reporting, and violence, so he was ready
to drag his children into the realm of death so that he might see his children
remain his children, remain people who spoke straight and lived honestly.

Mr. Thông left behind assets accumulated through years of sweat and labor,
but in truth, he was luckier than most of the others going, who had to leave
behind parents, wives, children, and siblings.

Mr. Thông’s family was accepted into the operation because with an
8-meter boat, transporting oil, people, and food down to the forest was
easier. Moreover, the family had Thái and Chánh, sturdy young men familiar
with the waterways and the Rừng Sát area, where they had been fishing
for months. Both were non-commissioned officers in the Republic of Vietnam
Armed Forces.

Besides fuel for the engines, there was food for the people. I planned to bring
100 kilos of rice, a bin of crushed noodles, a bin of dried bread, candy,
sugar, and powdered milk for the small children. Finding these things was a
struggle; getting them down to the forest was a thousand times harder. Even
so, everything was taking shape more clearly.

I held in my hand a small flotilla consisting of Mr. Thông’s large
*“single-block”* boat, which had a legal berth at Phú Xuân; two boats belonging
to Tư Nhiễn, also legal thanks to registration; and three illegal boats,
including one with a 5-horsepower diesel engine which by habit we called an F-4
boat, and two small boats equipped with Kohler engines. On paper, it sounded
quite impressive, but it was fraught with danger. Tư Nhiễn grimaced at me:

*“How is this going to work? The whole bunch will die. I can’t handle five
boats alone. The ward police already called me in; I told them the boats
were brought in for repairs. The neighbors are snooping around a lot already.”*

I, too, was frantic. The oil, bought in 10-liter increments, wasn't enough. Anh
Bé, who would be our captain, was still stuck at the labor site and hadn't
returned.

After two cups of strong coffee, an idea suddenly flashed in my mind.

*“How about we let them float?”*

Tư Nhiễn looked at me in surprise. I chuckled at my journalistic phrasing
and explained:

*“Can you and the two boys take the boats out of the dock and wander on the
river for a week? If you dock in a different place each time, surely it’ll
be okay.”*

Tư Nhiễn nodded:

*“A week might just work; any longer and it’s difficult. I can’t guarantee
it.”*

And so, now here, now there, the father and his two sons took the fleet of
five boats drifting all over the Tân Thuận, Cầu Hàng, Rạch Đía,
Phú Xuân, Phú Khánh areas. We played spy games. We set a specific time to
meet at a certain location. If there was an obstacle and someone didn't show
up 15 minutes after the set time, we would meet an hour later at a second
location, and if they still couldn't make it, it meant they were nabbed. And
so it went. Tư Nhiễn on the river, me running on the bank. Living in the
claws of the Communists, one had to be careful. Once, I escaped thanks to
being prepared.

On a reconnaissance mission to scout a fuel hiding spot, I was stopped and
questioned by border police. They demanded to see papers. Liễn, Tư Nhiễn's
son, and I claimed we were going woodcutting and didn't bring papers for
fear of losing them. They asked for our woodcutting tools; I pulled out two
iron-handled axes and a machete. They looked at our miserable faces and waved
us on. Every time I went down to the forest, I also bought a little wood to
bring back, pretending I was really doing business. Back in Saigon, I sold it
to recoup the capital. Because of this, although everyone was like brothers,
I didn't let them know too much. Only Chiến and I knew everyone's names
and addresses. There were two people who were very close friends, but they
only discovered they were in the same organization when they boarded the boat.

Chiến returned from Phước Hòa to say everything was smooth and we
could start as planned. The departure date was set for May 7, 1978.

I chose six strong young men to go down to the forest ahead on Labor Day,
May 1, one day after the tragic date of April 30, 1978--the day of mourning
for the regime. I remembered Hoàng Hải Thủy, a renowned writer who had
been jailed by the state for reactionary thoughts three months prior. In a
poem he wrote, there was a line:


*Every five years when the tragic day comes*  
*We light incense in our hearts to remember and mourn.*


Now he was being held in solitary confinement, denied contact with his wife and
children. Would he have the chance to quiet his heart and mourn what was lost?

I, a younger brother by exactly one twelve-year cycle, had been advised by him:

*“If you can leave, go. Then live like a human being.”*

I was trying to do exactly as he said.

At exactly 5 p.m. on May 1, six young men on our side were scattered among
the street stalls around Phú Xuân market.

At exactly 6 p.m., like a ghost, Tư Nhiễn appeared from somewhere, wearing
a conical hat, a dark blue shirt, boxer shorts, and barefoot. I calmly paid
for my limeade and walked out parallel to him. He whispered:

*“Don't go down near the warehouse, there's a militia boat. We have to go
down near the bridge foot...”*

I told him:

*“Alright. The first wave, three guys, go down with you first. Tell Cang to
come pick me up for the second wave. I'll wait here.”*

Tư Nhiễn nodded and turned away. Seeing my signal, three young men cut
across the asphalt road to follow him. Two minutes later, they vanished
under the bridge abutment. I carefully walked up onto the bridge to
monitor. The small boat began to turn. Tư Nhiễn stood at the bow, then
the stern. Điển, now wearing only boxer shorts, tried his best to row. A
skilled photographer by trade, Điển had volunteered for the first trip
and adapted to the circumstances very quickly. His clothes were tattered
and faded; he squatted and bobbed, wiggling the oar like anyone else.

I turned back to the old spot, reassured. There was a bus from Phú Xuân to
central Saigon, but it stopped running at 6 p.m. I waited for Cang until 6:30,
my heart pounding. The other three men knew nothing, ordering another bowl or
two of mung bean sweet soup at the nearby stalls. The sky grew dark. 7 p.m.,
still no sign. 8:30 p.m., Cang was still missing. What was happening? Caught
by the police? Unreasonable, because with the bustling scene of firewood
boats like this, the police couldn't possibly detect my group. Why hadn't
Cang come up to get me? I took a risk, searching among the bobbing boats
on the night water. No sign of Tư Nhiễn and his son. The sky had just
fallen, but it was pitch black because it was the end of the lunar month. I
felt like I was going mad, my body burning hot. How could this happen? What
happened? Disregarding security, I stood on a plank jutting out and called
out loudly, *“Brother Nhiễn! Cang!”* A few heads poked out from the holds
of nearby boats and looked up, but no one answered. The water surface still
churned with boats, but my flotilla had vanished without a trace. I checked
my watch: 8:30 p.m. So be it.

I went back to Phú Xuân market and ordered the three waiting men to go
home. They looked bewildered. I whispered:

*“Rest assured, it will be resolved later. Now, go home.”*

*“But there are no more buses.”*

*“Then walk.”*

I let two of them go ahead. Once they were out of sight, the other man and
I set off. My legs were heavy as lead, my head spun, my eyes blurred, but
I tried to appear calm so the others wouldn't be afraid.

According to the plan, the five boats were to carry seven people past the Nhà
Bè river junction to Tắc Ông Mai, where Chánh and Thái were waiting
with another boat and two others. That boat would tow the five small boats
just like any other group of boats going down to the forest to cut wood. Tư
Nhiễn hadn't met Thái. Thái didn't know Tư Nhiễn either. They were
all waiting for me while I dragged my feet on the road. What would happen
now? I walked blindly, my heart tangled like a mess of thread. Was Heaven
punishing us?

Today was Labor Day, so occasionally we passed groups of people forced to
enjoy *“mass culture”* performances on makeshift stages by the roadside. Even
though I didn't want to listen, the shrill singing still pierced my ears:

*“...Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh...”*

as if those two words displayed the same image. Uncle Ho was being deified
at all costs. Children sang: *“Last night I dreamed of meeting Uncle Ho... Who
loves Uncle Ho Chi Minh more than us children?”*

In the press, the front page always had to have his picture--sometimes hugging
a female anti-American hero, sometimes fondling a labor hero, sometimes
wearing wooden clogs watering a star apple tree, sometimes holding a baton
conducting a symphony orchestra... His words were the Bible, framed everywhere,
including words he mimicked from the ancients or stole from old books... It
was obnoxious to the point where a certain city resident had to say:

*“One day without seeing Uncle's picture, without reading Uncle's words, I
can't eat, can't sleep, can't relieve myself, speak incoherently, and when
I look in the mirror, I see a detestable face.”*

I laughed out loud at the story of some Southern children comparing Uncle Ho to
their idol when they saw him waving his baton conducting an orchestra. *“Seeing
Uncle Ho is like the Monkey King, Sun Wukong, wielding his magic staff and
dancing wildly.”* Even if called the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, in reality,
he was still just a monkey.

We finally managed the 13 kilometers back to the Saigon border at 11
p.m. Despite it being a major holiday and the curfew being lifted, the streets
were completely empty, with no shops and no pedestrians. My Saigon was dying
in the cradle of the regime.

All the next day, I ran hither and thither, searching for Tư Nhiễn and
the boat fleet until I finally caught him at dusk. I looked terrible,
but he looked even worse. His eyes were dull, his face yellow, his
cheekbones protruding. After just 24 hours, he seemed to have withered away
completely. The story gradually became clear.

His nerves were so strained that after taking the three people down, he went
straight across the Nhà Bè junction to Tắc Ông Mai. After anchoring the
boats, he remembered he had to pick up another group. He and Cang returned to
Phú Xuân, but it was already late. What could be done? Everyone was scared,
not just him. I tried to reassure him, asked the other three to temporarily
go back, and notified Chiến that there was a glitch.

Right at that moment, the state delivered a fatal blow to the masses: Currency
Exchange! Each person could exchange 50 đồng. A family could not exchange
more than 500 đồng. Anyone with more than the regulation amount had to
deposit it in the state bank. The people all knew that money deposited in
the state bank was as good as lost. They had experienced it once before. To
withdraw money from the bank, one had to submit an application stating the
reason and wait for the state to review it. Someone asked to withdraw money
to bury his father, but it wasn't until after the first death anniversary
that the cadre called him up to lecture him that he shouldn't waste money on
funerals, only use money for production. Of course, there was no withdrawing
money. That absurd story happened in Vietnam just like any other absurd
story--absurd to the point of disbelief, yet it still happened. Because of
the currency exchange, a curfew was imposed all day on May 3, 1978.

I was discouraged. Was there no way left? That night, Chiến suddenly
returned from Phước Hòa. The two of us looked at each other. Could we
have lost? Give up? No way. Chiến and I decided to be bold. Leave right
from Saigon, no more waiting.

The meeting was convened on the morning of May 4, including Tư Nhiễn,
Thái, and Chánh to facilitate coordination. A plan was formed in a flash,
full of daring. We would go in small groups of two to four people, boarding
the boats right in Saigon.

The first four people, who had missed the trip before, volunteered. I, Thái,
Chánh, and Điển risked our lives carrying the boat and transporting
oil down to the sampans docked at Cầu Hàng. On the first day alone, 300
liters got through safely. Thank goodness, the first trip was done, and the
flotilla dropped off the people and buried the oil at the designated spot,
returning on May 6. They left one boat with Tư Nhiễn's eldest son. The
second wave started immediately. At dusk on May 6, only Nguyễn Phúc was
picked up, while Hoài and chị Nhung were arrested. This incident made me
dare not be reckless anymore; I temporarily halted the oil transport.

At dawn on May 7, four more people went down to the boats to meet and go to
the forest with anh Phúc. They would meet Mr. Thông’s large boat on the
other side of the Phú Xuân creek. Nearly half the people had truly left
their families, stepping into the adventure. I had watched them step down
into the boats with worry. I prayed.

When faith is threatened with total extermination by violence, it flares up
intensely. I was born into a Buddhist family but had never gone to the temple
and always looked at monks with half an eye. But this time, I prayed with
all my sincerity. I did not pray for myself. I hoped for peace for my friends.

Among those reluctant woodcutters were Mr. Thông’s two daughters. They
were university students but decided to drop out when called to attend
political supplementary education. A person with a normal mind who knows
how to eat and sleep, knows right from wrong, would go crazy listening to
the political lectures of state cadres. Everything was distorted to the
utmost. History was twisted, religion was smeared, philosophy was bent,
all to lead to one conclusion: *“We must serve the regime without thinking,
without condition. We must bow our heads and labor without reasoning because
the Party takes care of all thinking.”* When people teach math to children by
adding up corpses, one must consider the gun as everything. *“One soldier in
the morning kills 8 puppets, in the afternoon shoots 6 others. Ask, how many
puppets went to their doom?”*


**The Rendezvous**

The bus reached the station, but I sat there numbly, startled only when the
conductor reminded me, *“We're at the station, sir!”* Phú Xuân was bustling
at this hour, with fishing boats bringing back their catch and firewood
boats preparing to ride the ebb tide. I went into a shop and ordered a
bowl of *bún*. I had just lifted my spoon when Chị Lan walked in with
two children. Turning around, I saw Chị Nhung, disheveled and carrying
a baby, asking her little sister what she wanted to eat. Looking out the
door, I saw Chị Điển standing across the street holding her child, and
Anh Hoài was also about to step in. I shook my head, and they understood,
moving diagonally away to another spot. I looked anxiously at the policeman
standing idly in front of the People's Police station. This was too much.

I had told them over and over last night to sit near the bus station, so why
were they all crammed into a place riddled with police? I silently continued
eating my noodles. The police station across the way had peeling whitewashed
walls and mossy black roof tiles, exuding an aura of death. Policemen in
boxer shorts held enamel mugs, running back and forth, seemingly going to
brush their teeth or looking for hot water to make coffee. The barbed-wire
fence remained as it had been for ages. It was truly convenient. The regime
had fully inherited the old facilities of the *“puppets,”* and I was reminded
of Du Fu:

*Lâu đài đệ trạch giai tân chủ*  
*Văn vũ y quan dị tích thì*

*Palaces and mansions all have new masters,*  
*Civil and military officials dress differently from times past.*

But Du Fu, though a literary giant, was perhaps of less use to me at this
moment than Tư Nhiễn. He walked sluggishly into the shop, pulled up a chair,
and ordered a glass of iced water. After drinking, he walked out casually,
blending into the market crowd. I called for the check and followed him.

*“Is it done?”*

*“Done. The boat is under the bridge. Wait for me to buy some food first.”*

The two of us, like a couple, haggled and carried a bundle of vegetables
and tomatoes out of the market. I jerked my head as a signal. Chị Lan,
Chị Chiến, and Chị Điển filed out one after another like they were
going to a festival.

Facing that situation, Tư Nhiễn quick-wittedly babbled:

*“Ha, we're going to visit Uncle Tư, okay?”* And he offered his muscular arm
to pick up Anh Chiến's child.

*“Smile now. Going down to the boat to Uncle Tư's house for fish rice, okay?”*

The little boy grinned wide. I led Chị Lan's child while Anh Hoài carried
Anh Điển's child. I also feigned nonchalance:

*“Gosh, what a crowd. Let's buy more bread to eat with curry to make it
enough. So many people.”*

Anh Tám emerged from some hidden corner, nobody knew which, and chimed in:

*“That's enough, Brother Sáu. Let's go, or the tide will rise and we won't
get across the creek mouth, we'll be late.”*

If any curious cop were around, he would have to understand we were going to
a death anniversary feast, especially since Chị Điển was holding three
sticks of incense. She said she had vowed to light incense to thank Heaven
once we reached the sea! I plunged into the water, holding the sampan close
to the bank. Anh Tám helped me get the children and the women aboard. Seeing
their clumsy movements, two or three heads popped up from nearby boats to
stare. But Tư Nhiễn was quick as a flash; as soon as the last person
was aboard, he pushed the boat off. Three minutes later, the boat drifted
slowly into the middle of the river. I stood at the bow, paddle in hand,
and paddled. From the other side of the river, two other small boats lazily
detached from the bank. Like a satellite docking in space, I snatched the
rope Cang threw to me and held tight. Cang slipped inside, started the F-4
engine, and we shot out into the big river.

I felt light. I counted. Good heavens. Eleven souls, young and old, on a tiny
sampan. Bằng, Tùng, Bình, and the little girl Oanh poked their heads out
and grinned at me. I smiled back, but my heart was not at peace. There were
still too many uncertainties ahead. According to plan, Thái and Chính's
boat wouldn't meet us until 5 p.m. at the Đồng Tranh junction. We were
leaving early because the boats were too small to cross the Phú Xuân creek
mouth against the tide. I asked Tư Nhiễn:

*“What do we do from now until 5 p.m.?”*
He laughed:
*“Well, we're going to a death anniversary, aren't we? Don't worry.”*

At 10 a.m., our three boats pulled into the riverbank near a field. There
was an abandoned thatched hut there. Perhaps a family had come here to farm,
to engage in direct production, but couldn't stand the hunger and sold
everything to return to the city. No one was surprised by such things anymore.

When the troops stumbled into Saigon, no matter what, the Vietnamese people
breathed a sigh of relief: *“That's the end of the gunfire!”* They thought of
a peaceful future. The state tirelessly promoted the idea of the fields,
of direct production, of building the country. It was very reasonable,
especially for those who had fled to the city to escape the bombs. Many
families in the city sold their houses and possessions to gather capital
and return to the countryside.

Reality turned against their humble dream. Seeds were impossible to
buy. Official fertilizer didn't exist; buying it outside cost ten times the
price. The regime knew nothing but measuring land and levying taxes. Without
support from the Party and state, and battered by three consecutive years of
natural disasters--sometimes drought, sometimes floods--they had no food,
no clothes, no medicine when sick, and education was a distant story. They
had to return to the city, regardless of the consequences. These victims
became people living on the margins of society for lack of legal residence
papers. Having no homes, they slept on sidewalks and streets. Not allowed to
buy food, they had to scrape by, meal to meal. Originally honest and simple
people, they were pushed by the regime into a life outside the law, becoming
dishonest, stealing for a living. Saigon was overflowing with people sleeping
on the streets. Every night, people slept in rows at the train station,
along Lê Thánh Tôn, Gia Long, Công Lý, Tự Do streets... Occasionally,
the police would stage a raid, bring trucks to scoop them up and toss them
into some remote area for *“direct production.”* But they escaped back to Saigon
because only here, despite the hunger, they wouldn't die. They weren't afraid
because they had nothing left to preserve. They were like wild beasts now,
empty stomachs, just hoping for something to stuff into their flat bellies.

We went into the empty hut to cook rice. I asked Tư Nhiễn and Bằng
to light the fire, asked Chị Lan and Chị Điển to clean the hut, and
I went around back to look. Cogon grass grew thick over a large area. Not
a soul in sight, just a few white storks circling back and forth. I felt
temporarily reassured and went back in. Tư Nhiễn seemed to have regained
his old spirit, joking happily with the children. He took them to catch
fiddler crabs and bathe in the river. Their innocent faces lit up with
delight. Everything was new to them.

*“What's this, Uncle Thiệp?”*  
*“A crab.”*  
*“Wrong. Uncle Tư says it's a fiddler crab.”*  
*“What's the difference between a fiddler crab and a crab?”*  
*“Fiddler crabs are small, crabs are big.”*  
*“This one is big, so why is it a fiddler crab?”*  
*“Don't drive your uncle crazy, kids.”*

Little Tí ran to tell his mother:  
*“Uncle Thiệp doesn't know anything at all.”*

I looked at Oanh and shook my head. She smiled and asked:  
*“Why are you shaking your head, Uncle?”*  
*“You're too pale. You're so pretty, if the police ask, I won't know what to
say. Going to a death anniversary, why are we groping around here?”*

Tư Nhiễn looked at me and scowled:  
*“Why are you afraid of everything? If they ask, we say we're going to Phước
Hòa, the tide is high now so we have to pull into the bank to wait for the
ebb. What's there to be afraid of? I'm not afraid anymore.”*

Honestly, I didn't know what I would do if we ran into militia. Every boat
looked like an enemy boat. That morning, an army patrol boat had glided past
us, looked around, then left, stopping everyone's heart. Oh well. The sun
grew fainter. A kingfisher perched on a date palm, tilting its head to watch
the river, waiting, then like an arrow, it dived into the rippling water. The
scene was peaceful, but my soul was restless. Tư Nhiễn thought ahead and
cooked a large pot of rice, but at that moment, no one ate a bite. We were
anxious about Thái's boat. At five o'clock, again it was Tư Nhiễn who
spotted it first when the boat was still a kilometer away. He whispered:
*“It's here!”*

We scattered into three boats and detached from the bank. Half an hour later,
another docking operation took place on the river. This month, it got dark
early. Within half an hour, we couldn't see each other's faces clearly. We
transferred all the women and children to the large boat so they could lie
in the covered hold. I also jumped over to the large boat to meet Mr. Thông
and Anh Bé. Mr. Thông recounted:  
*“In Phú Xuân, we were really stuck. We couldn't go down to the boat dock
because it was too dangerous. We had to go down at the market pier. Good
heavens, do you think fifteen people, big and small, lining up and climbing
down into a boat is scary? Surely something blinded them, or the whole bunch
of us would be dead.”*

I said:  
*“We're doing this entirely based on the element of surprise. The secret
police don't think we'd just sail out to sea right in front of them. That
part is over, but there's still the time from now until night.”*

I outlined the plan. Arrive at Bàn Thạch intersection at 10 p.m. Pick up
the group in the forest and dig up the oil. Go out to the Golden Sandbar at 1
a.m. to meet Chiến. Chiến promised to wait at most until 3 a.m. Mr. Thông
asked:  
*“What if we go out and don't meet Anh Chiến?”*  
*“Then we go back. Don't be afraid.”*

Mr. Thông was afraid, surely, but he wasn't the only one. I was afraid
too, and surely everyone was. Everyone tried to make themselves small
and silent. Fishing boats at work flickered with lights. Our flotilla
towed each other along proudly like any other group of boats. The waves
whispered. Mr. Thông gave me a piece of delicious candy. He whispered:  
*“Leftover old candy, I've been saving it.”*

At the big river bend leading into Bàn Thạch intersection, the wind rose
fiercely, and waves rocked the small boats as if to capsize them. A leaf
hat was blown into the river, almost sweeping two shivering people away with
it. Chị Điển's little boy cried out loudly. The children had been given
Phenergan mixed in milk and half a tablet of Valium. He should have been
sound asleep; I don't know what he dreamed of to make him cry. I threatened
Chị Điển:  
*“You settle him down. If he cries later when we get to the dangerous spot,
I'll throw both mother and child into the river.”*

Chị Điển silently soothed the child. When we reached the rendezvous
point at a Bàn Thạch intersection, the flotilla anchored. Tư Nhiễn
and I took a small boat to pick up the others. They were deep in a small
creek. Late at night, firewood boats lay silent on both banks. Occasionally,
a dry cough echoed from inside a boat. Tư Nhiễn and I tried to row as
softly as possible. Going deep into the creek, the water was shallow, the
boat couldn't go further. Tư Nhiễn stopped rowing. He observed silently,
then whispered to me:  
*“This is the creek. The date palm over there. Where are they?”*

I looked at him worriedly. Rừng Sát had a thousand faces. At high tide,
there was water everywhere; at low tide, mud banks emerged, the river
half-empty. The terrain was never the same twice. Had Tư Nhiễn made a
mistake? Silence around me. The air felt threatening. The date palms were
black in the silent night. Tư Nhiễn stuck the oar into the mud and tied the
boat. I understood immediately and went ashore with him. Mud up to the thighs,
very hard to walk. We splashed and waded. Where were my friends? After half
an hour, I was out of breath. Tư Nhiễn had waded up to a higher spot to
find me. I didn't know what to do anymore.

*“Ò... ò... ò...”*

I recognized Tư Nhiễn's voice immediately and tried to listen for
a reply. His hooting voice boomed, going deep and far, but there was no
reply. I continued splashing, soft mud covering my body; I fell and got up,
shivering with cold. Could they have been caught? If so, and I stumbled
in, it would be hard to escape. My heart was a tangle of threads. I felt
abandoned in the dark night. I heard another hoot. No answer. A moment later,
I heard Tư Nhiễn shout loudly: *“Liễng... ời...”* I burst out laughing,
though there was nothing funny in this situation. I remembered the time I was
left behind at Phú Xuân and shouted just like Tư Nhiễn. So, caution was
thrown to the wind. I thought for a moment, then turned back to the boat. So
be it. Tư Nhiễn also returned. We looked at each other worriedly. I asked:  
*“Are you sure about this creek?”*  
*“Sure! I know this place like my own house.”*  
*“They must understand that we're picking them up tonight. When the tide is
low, they should row out to the creek mouth. Very strange.”*

I decided to go back and meet Thái. Thái said the militia had just
questioned them. My heart stopped when I didn't see the F-4 boat, and I
shook my head. Thái told me that because Tư Nhiễn and I had been gone
so long, Cang and Anh Tâm had gone to pick up the others. They thought we
were in trouble.  
*“And the militia didn't search the boat?”*  
*“Luckily, they looked into the small boat and saw two people bailing water,
so they didn't search.”*

Thái jumped into my boat, and we decided to dig up the oil first and calculate
later. The water was rising. I looked. Nearly one a.m. Chiến might have
already gone to the rendezvous point. We started the long-tail motor and
pulled the throttle full. The explosion roared in the late night. Arriving
at the bush marking the oil, we looked. Empty. Tư Nhiễn and I jumped
down to grope and found it immediately. Overjoyed, forgetting the cold,
I bobbed up and down digging out each can of oil buried in the mud. Thái
stood on the boat, constantly urging me. When the last can was up, I covered
the whole boat with a sedge mat and returned. With the oil, I was temporarily
relieved on one front, and when we got back, I saw the F-4 boat tied alongside
Mr. Thông's boat. Điển poked his head out from the camouflaging board,
looked at me, and whispered:
*“Nice work.”*
I smiled back. *“Still tough.”*

It was now two a.m. I ordered the anchor raised. The tide was rising, so we
went against the waves. Even though Thái pulled the throttle full, I still
felt slow. The remaining distance, even fast, took 45 minutes. Seeing me
shivering, Tư Nhiễn handed me a lit pipe. The smoke was bitter but warmed
me. I silently drew long puffs, my mind blank. Chị Điển's little boy
screamed, but the scream was cut short. Surely he was gagged. I remembered
stories that made me shudder. There were leaders who gritted their teeth and
strangled babies to death in front of the mother. For the safety of the whole
group, the mother had to watch her child die without a complaint. Would I dare?

Tư Nhiễn whistled at me and whispered, *“Saw it.”* Chiến's boat was
anchored in the middle of the junction.

Later he recounted that he had been waiting since exactly one a.m. By three
a.m., not seeing us, he was about to pull anchor when the flotilla appeared. He
said, *“If you were five minutes later, I would have gone. Anchoring too long
is dangerous.”*

Disregarding all calculations, we pulled right up to the big boat. I,
Tư Nhiễn, and Thái handled the oil. The others handled the luggage,
bringing the women and children into the forward holds. Chiến's voice
hissed through his teeth, *“Hurry up! The whole bunch will die now.”* Everyone
was frantic. Mrs. Thông was grabbed around the waist and shoved down the
hold. Anyone finding a spot just crawled in. Perhaps in just a few minutes,
Chiến started the engine. The boat shook violently and turned its bow toward
the mouth. I was in the engine room looking out. It was getting light. On
deck, there were only Chiến, Anh Bé, and Nghi. Everyone else sat or lay
piled on top of each other, curled up in three narrow holds.

The boat was 11 meters long and 3 meters wide, too small to carry 48
people. The smell of oil rose thick in the engine room. Engine heat radiated
fiercely. In just a moment, I was soaked in sweat. Looking to the side,
Hiệu was slumped over vomiting. Tùng and Đàn, their faces green as
banana leaves, asked me:  
*“Do you have any oil for motion sickness?”*  
I comforted them:  
*“Hold on! In a bit, you can go up and feel better.”*

The boat lunged up and down with the waves, knocking everything in the hold
askew. My stomach clenched. I tried to suppress it. Chiến looked down and
asked me:  
*“Is anyone missing?”*  
*“All here. It's suffocating in here, I can't breathe.”*  
*“Try to breathe. Can't go up here. They have binoculars, seeing more than
three people on the boat is trouble.”*

I tried to breathe, and sweat poured out. Đàn begged:  
*“Let me up for just a bit. I'm about to faint.”*  
*“No.”*

The boat still jumped the waves, tossing us like cotton. Chiến stuck his
head down again:  
*“Passing the Cần Giờ lighthouse soon, this is the scariest spot. Don't
poke your heads out. The whole bunch will die.”*  
*“Rest assured, is the sea rough? Are there PCFs there?”*  
*“No. The sea is a bit rough. It'll be calm in a bit.”*

Chiến lied to reassure me. The sea was violently rough that day. Normally at
the Cần Giờ lighthouse, the border police anchored a PCF--colloquially
known as a landing craft, or *“open-mouthed ship.”* A month earlier, a group
of our friends had been intercepted and caught at this very spot. The leader
jumped into the sea to commit suicide along with the boat operator. I thought
of the Colt 45 pistol Chiến had given me. We had agreed to commit suicide if
caught. But I had thrown the gun away on Mr. Thông's advice. Experience showed
that a small gun couldn't do anything but cause trouble for others. Right
then, Chiến called down:
*“Passed the lighthouse, where's the gun?”*
I mumbled:
*“Dropped it just now.”*
I heard him curse. So be it. If I had to jump into the sea, I'd die anyway. I
remembered the things that happened right here. One boat hit a reef, 34 people
died, only 4 survived. Another case, 27 people. Truly the Gate of Death. From
the engine room, I saw the flashing lighthouse. Chiến's voice echoed down:
*“There's a landing craft, don't look up.”*

Hiệu, clutching his stomach, looked up at me. Tùng and Đàn also raised
their heads anxiously. I waved my hand. Later, reviewing the events, everyone
concluded that the enemy ship didn't bother intercepting us because the
sea was too rough. Perhaps they thought that with such a tiny boat, we were
just fish food. The boat still shook violently, lunging high then plunging
down. I was exhausted. Seeing Chiến look down, I whispered:
*“Let me up or I'll die.”*

After thinking for a moment, he reached out to pull me up and told the other
three to come up too.


**Setting Sail**

The sea breeze was sweet. The air smelled fresh. The sky was brightening. I
looked back; Vũng Tàu sparkled in the distance. *“That's Vũng Tàu,
my friend; you've only escaped when you can't see it anymore.”* Farewell,
Vietnam. Farewell, homeland, motherland, fatherland. Farewell, Vũng Tàu,
Front Beach, Back Beach, Ô Quắn, Roche Noir, the golden sand beach, and
the images of long-ago days spent lying in the sun. The sea was a pale blue.

The waves were larger than the boat. Anh Bé said to me:

*“If our lot isn't to beg for mercy, we can say we've escaped.”*

From the back, Thái crawled over. He told me: *“Thank you.”* Hiệu, though
green and wilted, added: *“I can smell freedom already. Thank you so much. Well
done.”* Anh Bé also expressed: *“Naturally, it's well done.”*

I smiled. Too tired. *“Let me into the cabin to lie down a bit.”* Chiến
helped me lean back, and I fell asleep amidst the fierce waves.

The pungent smell seeping into my nostrils woke me. Anh Tám was speaking
loudly: *“The cabin is for women and children. Men go down to the holds to
lie down.”* I sat up. Around me were haggard faces, disheveled clothes, and
tousled hair. The boat was still being tossed violently. White-capped waves
swept over the deck; everyone was soaking wet. Exhausted, I tried to crawl
out. Thái, Nam, and Chánh were passing the children one by one to lean
against the cabin, the relatively safest spot. It was a hold nearly two
meters wide and three meters long. My neck hurt, my legs were giving out,
my arms didn't want to lift. Mr. Thông lay nearby, dozing. Chị Điển and
Chị Chiến were helped in. Then the children--Bi, Ti--and the girls Oanh,
Ánh Mai... Everyone nodded at me. I nodded back and crawled outside to ask:

*“Where's Anh Phúc? Where's Điển?”*

*“Passed out. Vomiting green and yellow bile.”*

A light rain fell, shivering cold. I asked Anh Bé: *“Are we far yet?”*

*“Not far enough, but don't worry. In seas like this, there isn't a soul
around to fear. I estimate the waves are Force 7.”*

*“So, a storm?”*

*“A small storm.”*

Groping my way forward, I looked into each hold. My brothers, my friends
were all there. Though seasick and dizzy, they all smiled at me. The Vomitop
seasickness pills were useless. Reaching the bow hold, I looked in. Anh
Phúc and Bằng lay curled up.

*“How are you?”*

*“Surviving like this is a miracle.”*

*“Indeed, a miracle.”*

*“Hey, why don't you praise me for being good?”*

*“Of course you're good, but it's truly a miracle. There is Heaven. There
is Heaven.”*

Once everyone was settled with a place to sit, I looked for Chánh.

*“Rice, water situation?”*

*“Indochinese tragedy. Waves knocked over a water jar. Another jar tilted,
spilling half. The food left on the small boat is half gone. Crushed noodles,
dried bread couldn't be brought. Milk is sufficient.”*

*“Why?”*

*“Chiến urged us too much, everyone lost their heads. Just getting the
women and children up took everything we had. What can be done now?”*

I called Thái up to discuss. We decided to limit food and drink
immediately. Thái smiled: *“Don't worry. No one can eat yet. Vomiting
everywhere. It's raining, so no one is drinking water.”*

Just then, Chiến shouted from the rear: *“Military boat!”*

To our left, a boat bobbed, crossing our path. I asked Anh Bé: *“Is it them?”*

*“Maybe. If it were a fishing boat, they wouldn't be out working in seas like
this. If they were already at sea, they'd be heading into shore. Don't be
afraid, it's too far away to catch us. It moves about the same speed as us.”*

Everyone silently watched the adversary also bobbing up and down among the
white-capped waves. What if they intercepted us? I pushed the thought away
and, as Anh Bé predicted, the distance between us remained constant. Over
an hour later, the enemy vessel turned another way.

The sea remained fierce. Tư Nhiễn came to ask if I wanted to eat; I shook
my head. Rain still fell, everyone wet as drowned rats. Moving on the boat
was extremely dangerous as it tossed beyond imagination. Crawling to the bow,
I was thrown into the sea by a wave. Luckily, I was cautious and grabbed a
rope, so I was pulled up. There were cases where people fell overboard and
were left behind because they couldn't be rescued in time. I crawled into
the forward hold and curled up with Anh Phúc, Bằng, and Nam. Perhaps from
exhaustion, I drifted into a light, floating sleep.

The next morning, the rain stopped, but it was still overcast. Everyone
seemed used to the sea, much more alert. Anh Bé said we would have to head
inside Côn Sơn island. Yesterday's rough seas made him dare not go far out
as planned, circling outside the island. He had to choose a route close to
the coast, which meant the danger of being intercepted by enemy ships still
remained. Perhaps because of the vast expanse of sky and water, no one paid
attention to Anh Bé's warning, but there was trouble with something else. The
water pump was broken because the dynamo was soaked with seawater and no
longer worked. I assigned buckets for bailing. This was hard work because the
engine room was hot, slippery, and cramped. Two people per shift. We bailed
day and night. The boat ran well. Everyone was happy. A little boy asked me:

*“When will we get there, Uncle?”*

*“Soon, hang in there.”*

*“I'm hungry.”*

*“Eat a little or you'll vomit and be very tired.”*

*“I'm not vomiting anymore. I'm hungry.”*

*“You'll vomit again soon. Tomorrow Uncle will take you to eat phở.”*

The boy looked at me doubtfully. Suddenly, I craved phở unbearably. Bà
Dậu's phở with clear broth and soft meat, without a hint of beef smell. Gia
Long phở, clear but sweet. Tàu Bay phở, rich and spicy. Phở Number
One of the Fat Lady, strong with the scent of radish. Pasteur phở with
the rare *“tái sữa”* cut. Cao Vân phở, never could finish a bowl. Oh,
Phở. Oh, Vietnam. I missed it the moment I left. I looked at the boy,
my heart softening:

*“Go find Anh Thái and ask him to mix a glass of milk. Remember to say Uncle
Thiệp gave permission.”* I knew Thái was principled, never giving more
than the ration to anyone, so I had to instruct the boy carefully.

The boat still plunged through the vast ocean. Everyone gradually revived. Anh
Phúc, though a man of few words, laughed and asked me this and that. People
still took turns bailing water in the hold. The quietest now was Tư
Nhiễn. He asked me:

*“Can we go back, sir? I miss Vietnam so much!”*

*“We'll go back. But where have we reached to go back? Calm down, Anh Tư.”*

The boat still dove deep then surged high. Sometimes I thought it would
flip. Anh Bé said he had turned the boat to go around the outside of Côn
Sơn. According to him, going this way only meant dealing with wind and waves,
less fear of interception. He told me:

*“Anyway, we're out here now, can't retreat. If I were a captain like in the
old days, I wouldn't dare take a ship out in times like this. But now it's
different. Better to die in the middle of the sea.”*

*“Agreed with you from the start.”*

Shivering cold. Soaking wet, we looked for places that seemed drier. The
needle indicating the engine's revolution was still active, the engine still
cracked sharply, but the boat wasn't moving. Chiến stopped the engine to
check. Thái jumped into the water and surfaced to say the propeller had fallen
off. Everyone looked at each other in surprise. I remembered clearly buying
this propeller with Thái from some Chợ Lớn Chinese men about two weeks
before leaving. Chiến had said the old propeller was only about 54 cm wide,
making the boat run weakly, so he suggested buying a bigger one. The two of
us sneaked around all afternoon to find a 64 cm one, at a terrible price: 240
đồng. The heavy brass propeller, I couldn't lift it alone, yet it could
fall off. Nam jumped down to check again, and the next news was even more
tragic. The propeller was lost. It was too dark, so we anchored. Luckily,
the waves lessened. We lay sprawled on the boat seats, not knowing what the
future held. Perhaps too tired, no one bothered to think, just fell asleep.

Morning, the sun rose early. Chiến luckily still had the old propeller in the
engine room. We tried to fit it, but no screw fit the shaft. Anh Tư Nhiễn
disassembled parts of the broken machine, found a slightly wide screw. We
decided to fit it and tie it with lead wire. In the history of boating,
surely only our boat ran with a propeller assembled so makeshift. When the
engine started, everyone waited anxiously. The boat moved forward and sped
up. Surprisingly, it worked.

Rain fell again with a low, gloomy sky. Shivering cold. The children's lips
were pale, my heart sank. All the raincoats had been lost. Everything was
soaked, but by evening the sky gradually cleared. High up, stars twinkled.

*“There are lights, a ship.”*

From far away on the horizon, we saw two spots of light. We discussed and
decided to light the emergency lights. The electrical system on the boat was
ruined by seawater. We lit torches and waved frantically, using a blanket
to play *“Red Indian”* and signal SOS. The two lights grew clearer. Everyone
cheered. These were probably two fishing boats traveling together. They
approached us, splitting up to flank us on either side. Everyone rushed out
joyfully, shouting. We saw sailors on board. But the joy didn't last. They
slowly cut through the waves and left. Anh Bé told me:

*“I hope we're on the right course for the Malay Peninsula. We'll see many
more ships.”*

Just as we got over the disappointment, Thái reported even sadder news. Water
and food, though limited to the max, were now in full alarm. I regretted the
food left behind, terribly. Had to limit even more. Drinking water, each person
was allowed one capful per time, three times a day. No exceptions. Calculating
that, each person got only about 15cc of water and a ball of rice the size
of a tangerine in a day. Poor children.

*“I'm hungry.”*

*“I'm thirsty.”*

*“Is there milk, Uncle?”*

I joked to make them happy. I promised nonsense. I soothed and comforted. But
they only forgot for a moment then asked again. What could I do? The adults
didn't complain. I crawled into the small hold at the bow to pray.

The sun rose higher. By noon, we were sweating profusely. The sun shone
brilliantly. We took turns scooping seawater to pour on the deck to cool
down. I shouted at the boys, forcing them to crawl inside to save energy,
but they complained it was suffocating inside. We had encountered, seen,
near and far, 13 large ships. They paid us no heed, casually going their
way. Thái told me he just re-checked. 12 liters of water left. I didn't
know what to say. Just then, around 3 p.m., a shout from the rear:

*“Ship!”*

I looked at the ship's silhouette in the distance, my heart unmoved. Hard
to force them to stop. Anh Bé observed then said:

*“It's going the same direction as us. Let me intercept.”*

He turned the boat in a circle before the large ship's path. It
stopped. Everyone cheered wildly. Anh Bé pulled alongside. Everyone
had revived. Anh Phúc and Anh Bé would go up to *“negotiate.”* Sailors
and passengers came out to look at us curiously. We saw the ship's name:
*MANOZ PUSAN*, A, Korean ship. Our side. But even if they were our side,
they absolutely wouldn't let Anh Phúc up. When he grabbed the iron ladder,
climbing near the deck, they put out their foot signaling if he came up
further, they'd kick him down. We shouted:

*“Water, water.”*

They threw down a fresh water hose. We brought out all the containers to
fill. We needed more fuel because the boat currently only had about 100
liters. Many loud shouts:

*“Gasoline.”*

Nghi carried the empty tank to signal. Anh Phúc still refused to come down. He
hung on the ladder like a frog, clothes soaking wet. I heard him shout:

*“We come in peace.”*

Among the well-dressed Koreans, I saw a young woman looking down at us in
surprised curiosity. Anh Phúc still shouted. His voice sounded lost. The
captain waved to Nghi. Quick as a flash, Nghi tied 4 cans to a rope for the
*MANOZ* sailors to pull up. A moment later, they lowered two 40-liter cans
and signaled that was all. They determinedly waved Anh Phúc away. Anh Bé,
thinking of the voyage, tied a map the size of a hand, torn from a large map,
asking the captain to confirm the position. Seeing the small children on our
boat, a few sailors ran inside. A moment later, they came out and threw down
a box of powdered milk. Many others threw down instant noodle packets. The
captain signaled to Anh Phúc that if he didn't get off the ladder, they
would kick him. He had to climb down. The bulky iron ship slowly cut through
the waves, leaving behind 48 souls drifting in a tiny boat. They were all
heading towards Singapore.

Taking stock, we *“begged”* 40 packs of noodles, water, and 40 liters
of fuel. Besides that, we knew we were still 360 nautical miles from
Singapore. Happy, but the joy didn't last when re-examining the fuel we
currently had. I told Thái to continue keeping food and water rations at
the lowest level because we didn't know how long we'd drift.

The night was beautiful. Dim moonlight but a clear sky. The sea surface
was like a flat mirror. Everyone looked around. The majestic scenery of the
ocean made us tremble with fear. Anh Bé predicted:

*“All my life at sea, I've never seen a sea as calm as tonight. Experience
shows the sea might be rough and stormy tomorrow. I fear a big storm.”*

Everyone looked at each other worriedly. True to Anh Bé's word, rain fell at
dawn. The sky was covered with low black clouds, seemingly within reach. Waves
hit as if to break the boat. Just then, a major accident occurred. The engine
stopped. We looked at each other, no one said a word. Anchor down. The nearly
200-meter anchor line was let out. I called Chánh over:

*“I checked carefully. Our air starter tank only has 12 kilos of pressure
left. Needs at least 16 kilos to start.”*

*“Any other way?”*

*“With the current condition. No.”*

Chiến, Nghi, Thái, Anh Bé, and even Tư Nhiễn looked at me as if I
could perform a miracle. I calmly announced:

*“Find a place you can crawl into and sleep. Lie down to regain strength. Rarely
do we get to sleep in the middle of a storm. Standing here is cold, your
lungs will get inflamed.”*

Not a word of protest. I crawled back to the bow hold and squeezed in. Bằng
and Anh Phúc looked at me.

*“No way out. Go to sleep, gentlemen.”*

I curled up like a shrimp against the hull, legs propped on the other
side. The bow hold was too narrow, so the three of us had to lie in that
weird posture from the first day. My hip pressed against the wood edge,
hurting gradually. My tailbone felt a heavy blow, stinging with pain. Is this
the end for the Lê family? I lay still, eyes wide open. Rainwater trickled
onto my head and neck. Anh Phúc was also silent. Tư Nhiễn poked his
head down. I grinned, trying to smile at him. He didn't smile. He dropped
down. The three of us squeezed together to make room for him. He pulled out
a cigarette. Lit it amidst everyone's surprise. We had run out of cigarettes
yesterday. The cigarettes brought, though wrapped carefully in nylon, were
soaking wet. Passing the cigarette around, we smoked silently. Anh Tư asked:

*“Are we still far from shore?”*

*“Close to dropping dead.”*

Anh Tư didn't ask more. He seemed to know the shore was still too far,
the boat was still being tossed by waves. I heard the waves hitting the hull
loudly, my heart aching for the fragile wooden planks. Thái crawled over and
gave each person a piece of sticky rice cake half the size of a cigarette
pack. That was the ration for the whole day. We nibbled slowly, thinking
vaguely. I turned to ask Anh Phúc, *“How is Brandy different from Cognac?”* He
explained thoroughly which Whisky was good. He said Chivas Regal. Originally
a university professor, having held many important positions, he showed
he understood the etiquette and customs of countries around the world very
well. *“German beer with hot sausage is the best. Eat fish, must drink white
wine.”* We were pretending to forget the reality. *“Actually, London is very
boring. Paris is fun but needs a lot of money. But in Holland, looks that
way but it's good. People here are gentle, flowers beautiful and plentiful,
climate pleasant. Northern Europe? Sweden is very advanced...”* And so, we
talked about places where probably no one at this hour could imagine our
circumstances. Anh Tư also listened silently to the random stories.

Past noon, the rain stopped, but waves were still large. Walls of water
larger than the boat tossed us high and plunged us low. I crawled to the
rear. Everyone shivered from cold and hunger. I gritted my teeth and told Thái
to mix milk for the kids. Nghi and Chiến found me to suggest heating the
engine's air tank; the pressure would increase. Agreed immediately. Everyone
gathered to stoke the fire. I looked at the gauge; it only showed 8 kilos
after 2 hours of heating. Pressure crept up to 9 kilos and then didn't
rise. Another suggestion was made. Thái disabled one cylinder, letting
only one piston work. Do it immediately. Like that, we tried to turn things
around. The engine sat silent, still. Hand crank it? Let's try, brothers. Nghi,
Nam, and Anh Tư Nhiễn, the three strongest, rolled up their sleeves. They
cranked like mad but couldn't overcome the minimum torque needed to engage
the flywheel. Their hands were raw. Chánh came close to me and whispered:

*“I'm not being pessimistic, but this engine can't be hand-cranked. You see,
when manufactured, the engineer didn't make a spot for cranking. Don't
waste energy.”*

I told everyone to stop. *“Go to sleep, folks.”* The three *“warriors,”* being
too tired, were allowed to eat a pack of noodles and drink half a glass of
milk. Anh Tư couldn't bear to eat alone, hesitated looking at the precious
food then called Cang over, gave it all. Cang looked at his dad and shook
his head. On the roof, a shout: *“Ship.”*

Hiệu and Anh Tám, on rescue duty, waved frantically. An SOS sign had been
made, but the ship, like the others, casually left. I climbed to the roof
and asked Hiệu:

*“How many have rejected us now?”*

*“Stopped counting. Us Vietnamese are truly unwanted lepers, total outcasts,
nobody wants to get involved.”*

Darkness fell. Everyone was miserable. Đàn, Tùng, Thịnh didn't complain
a word, but clearly they were starving. I soothed, comforted them, and
assigned bailing duties. Anh Tám and Hiệu stayed awake all night to call
for help if they saw a ship. The children seemed to go limp from hunger. The
two smallest, Chiến's and Điển's, cried constantly. One of Anh Bé's
children passed out despite having drunk a special glass of milk. Too tired,
I crawled into the cramped hole with Anh Phúc and Bằng, who had gone limp
in the curled position, ears hearing the waves hitting the hull noisily.


**The Sun Swallow**

May 16. The brothers decided to rig a sail. Anh Tư tied three scarves and
Hiệu’s yellow cassock together to form a large sail. A gentle breeze blew,
and the fabric puffed out.

*“It's moving, Anh Tư!”*

*“Pull up the anchor!”*

*“We're almost to shore, Anh Tư!”*

In reality, the boat probably wasn't moving, or was moving very
slowly. Strictly speaking, it was just drifting, but everyone was happy. I
heard Bằng at the bow softly reciting:

*“The sea is endless, what does direction matter?*

*Oh boat, I beg you, dock at a lonely shore.”*

It was a poem by the poet Vũ Hoàng Chương that we had learned from
Teacher Ý back at Chu Văn An. I looked at Bằng:
*“Hey, do you remember Mr. Trần Đình Ý?”*

Suddenly, we seemed to disdain all our troubles. The women and girls vied
to sit out by the stern to scoop water for baths. The children took turns
splashing water over each other's heads. The sun rose higher. Belongings
that had been soaked for days were brought out to dry. The scene on the ship
looked like a refugee camp. No one was sad. Nam, sitting by the side of the
boat, suddenly cried out:
*“A snake!”*

A small but long sea snake, black back, pale yellow belly, was swimming
leisurely in the blue water.
*“If you meet a snake, you go; if you meet a turtle, you return. We’ll
definitely get there. Trust me.”*

Everyone believed Nam. Perhaps that miraculous optimism helped us escape
death. Besides, dying here was joyful too. Giant flying fish leaped up and
down before the bow, giving us a free show.

The sea was fairly calm. If we had enough food and water, drifting like this
forever would be delightful. But the harsh reality was that we were hungry and
thirsty. We couldn't afford to waste anything. I instructed Thái carefully:
be resolute, issue only the exact ration regulated. Let the children cry;
it couldn't be helped. I looked at Anh Phúc's lips, dry and cracked,
my heart aching. I looked at Đàn, seeming about to faint, not knowing
what to say. Brother! Sister! For freedom, we had to leave our homeland;
to live a human life, we had to go. To go was to accept everything. Dying
in the middle of the sea was joyful too. I leaned against the boat’s
side. Little Oanh mumbled prayers to the Virgin Mary. A moment later, Oanh
burst into tears. I was surprised:  
*“What is it?”*

*“Now I miss my mom. Before, she took care of everything. Now...”*  
*“Nonsense. Look how many uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters are here. What
do you want?”*  
*“I miss my mom.”*  
*“I miss my mom too. My mother is now a lonely old soul. She spoiled me
too. But my mother had to let me go. Your mother accepted your leaving
too. Those mothers love their children so much, yet they had to grit their
teeth and watch them go. We must be worthy of that sacrifice. Fight on,
Oanh. Cheer up. If Oanh is happy, Mom is happy at home.”*

That night, stomach hungry, mouth thirsty, we gazed at the stars in the
sky. Large ships traveled back and forth busily. We lit a fire to signal
for help, but in vain. Anh Tư lay stretched out beside me.

*“That's the Plough. That cluster is the Pleiades. That hazy spot over there
is Khuê Star.”*


*“Nine Khuê stars lie side by side,*  
*Loving you since mother returned to father.”*


*“Thinking about it, the ancients were really smooth talkers, huh?”*

*“I don't know about smooth talking. My old man said if I was to get married,
I got married. No flirting involved. But I miss her now. Decades of living
together, yet I had to leave. Really. Why didn't you take a wife with you?”*

*“Every one of them is stuck back there, Anh Tư!”*

We lay there sharing bits and pieces of our thoughts, and I drifted into a
light sleep. Early the next morning, Anh Tư woke me. The sail hung limp
without wind, sorrowfully. The sea had light waves. The boat bobbed like
a cork, motionless. The sun hadn't risen yet, but the east was already
bright. Surely today would be sunny again. I worried about the remaining
water. Anh Tư hugged his knees and looked at me:  
*“What's the plan? We can't just leave it like this, can we? Last night,
not a single ship paid attention to us.”*  
*“Stay calm, Anh Tư, we're almost to shore.”*

Chánh and Nam crawled over to me.  
*“We have to do something.”*

I called everyone over and said:  
*“We are in a tight spot. The hope of being rescued by a ship is too faint. Does
anyone have an idea?”*  
*“Make a net to catch fish. Yesterday I saw fish behind the boat. Having fish
to eat would help a lot,”* Hiệu suggested.  
*“I suggest writing a distress message and dropping it into the sea.”*

We executed both ideas. The distress note was written in English, roughly
stating that 48 people escaping the Communist hell were in a desperate
situation, without water, without food, and with a broken engine. We tied
the distress letters to plastic barrels and dropped them into the sea. Six
were sent off.

While I was busy with Anh Phúc writing the distress letters, there were
cheers from the rear. A school of fish had gotten caught in the net. In total,
we caught 37 fish the size of two fingers. Estimated at nearly a kilo. Besides
that, there was one as big as a wrist with faint stripes. After deliberation,
the brothers agreed to cook fish porridge. Each person got nearly a bowl. I
sipped it slowly. Never had a bowl of porridge tasted so good. The porridge
was sweet, soaking into my heart, liver, spleen, and lungs. A little boy
brought his bowl in to ask for more. Everyone laughed. It's all gone, not
even the bones are left.

That was the only school of foolish fish to swim into our tiny net. The
official fishing net on the boat had to be thrown away right when we passed
the Cần Giờ lighthouse. This tiny piece of net was brought by the group
from the forest, originally just a hand net for catching shrimp in the river
shallows. No one believed it would be so useful.

The joy from the fish didn't last long because the sun grew more intense by
the hour. Hiệu and Nam found me:  
*“Why not build a raft? Send an envoy; maybe we'll escape.”*  
These two suggested using four plastic barrels tied together, and they
would go, hoping to meet a rescue ship or find an island. They only asked
for two packs of noodles and half a liter of water per person. I asked for
the brothers' opinions. No one agreed. Live together, die together. Hiệu
and Nam insisted on executing the plan but were not allowed.

Anh Tư pondered, then pulled me aside:  
*“I'll speak to you privately, then you ask everyone. Is it right to die so
unreasonably like this? Why don't we break some planks to make oars? If we
keep rowing, we must reach shore, right?”*  
*“Can a boat this size be rowed?”*  
*“If not, we row anyway! We have to do something.”*

The will to live is truly terrifying. I stared at Anh Tư. The sea sun had
turned him swarthy like a black bronze statue. His chin was square, exuding
determination. Even worms and ants want to live, let alone humans.  
*“Let's do it, Anh Tư.”*

Everyone gathered to find a way to make oars. I was clumsy and ignorant of
this type of work, so I was allowed to go up to watch for ships to signal
for help. I laughed at Anh Phúc's comment regarding the indifference of
the large ships: *“Truly, the way of the world.”* An intellectual like him
couldn't speak harshly of anyone. The ships still went back and forth in
all directions. I asked Hiệu:  
*“Counted how many yet?”*  
*“At least 43, not counting the ones too far away that we skipped.”*  
*“What were the names of the ships that passed nearby this morning?”*

Picking up chị Lan's tiny vanity mirror, I asked:  
*“How do you signal SOS?”*  
*“Three short – three long – three short.”*

A ship passed on the left. I flashed the mirror. Hiệu used a white flag to
wave frantically. Two or three others took turns waving. The ship was big,
white, elegant in shape, cutting the waves beautifully. White foam spread
from the bow down both sides. The ship showed no sign of caring about us
and kept its old course. The weather gradually cooled, then darkness fell
without me noticing. I went down to find Anh Tư:  
*“Are the oars done?”*  
*“Almost. Tomorrow morning, six oarsmen, why worry about not reaching shore?”*

The wind blew lightly, enough to puff out the large sail. I leaned back
beside little Tí. The boy had lost a lot of weight, his cheeks no longer
chubby. I smiled, but he didn't smile back like usual. I silently looked
at the little face, thinking of terrifying images. Thái had announced that
the water was only enough to hold out for one more day. If hunger and thirst
struck, surely the children would die first. There have been fathers who ate
their children. Would I... I looked at the boy lying limp, shaking my head,
not daring to think further.

Since morning, each person had received a half-bowl of porridge and a sip of
water. My throat was dry, my voice hoarse. I swallowed saliva continuously
and coaxed myself to sleep. The night finally passed. We had been drifting
for over a week and still didn't know where fate would drift us. Strangely,
not a single person on the boat was worried or afraid. Since dawn, Tư
Nhiễn had been rallying everyone. In total, only 4 oars were finished, so
we agreed to divide into 4 shifts. Each person rowed for half an hour. Cang
and Tư Nhiễn had to instruct for a while before we rowed correctly.
*“Hey! Is the boat moving?”*  
*“Moving fiercely. Come on, brothers. Rowing like medieval slaves is good
enough.”*

It was a joke Tư Nhiễn heard. The brothers laughed and rowed harder. Those
whose turn it hadn't come yet had to crawl into the hold to avoid sweating. We
took turns rowing, leaning the oars together, lunging forward for momentum,
leaning back lightly, pushing like professional oarsmen. The boat seemed to
be moving. But more importantly, we were fighting. The sea was beautiful but
deadly because of the sun. We had to pour water continuously onto the deck,
fighting against the terrible thirst. Thái accurately reported we had nearly
60 liters of water left, 40 packs of noodles, and half a kilo of sugar. Not
enough for one meal for 48 people.

I instructed Thái repeatedly to be resolute in issuing rations. Two caps
of water a day. Four people per pack of noodles. If we could maintain this,
we could fight for another 4 days and nights. I also hoped it would rain.  
*“Hang in there, we're almost there, brothers!”*

There was a dragonfly. We looked in surprise at that tiny brown creature. Why
was it here? I asked Anh Bé, the most authoritative among us. He shook his
head. Either he didn't know if there were dragonflies at sea, or perhaps
there was a desert island nearby. Nevertheless, that tiny creature instilled
excitement in us.

Around 9 a.m. that day, a heavy Night Heron landed on the bow. Hiệu was
sitting nearby, staring blankly. The heron, perhaps surprised by the cluttered
scene, nodded its head then flapped its wings and flew. The brothers shouted:  
*“Why didn't you grab it?”*  
*“Poor thing. It looked so tired.”*

Ah, another pitiful soul, unwilling to kill even a small creature. Nam
regretted it terribly. That heron would have fed us for a day. Everyone
laughed. The heron was quite large, flapping its wings slowly, flying
north. Hiệu deduced:  
*“The heron flies slowly and can't fly far. Definitely near shore. Come on,
brothers!”*

I remembered the lines from *Teng Wang Ge* and never found them as beautiful
as now:  
*"Wild ducks and lone gulls fly together,*  
*Autumn water and the vast sky share one color."*

The sun still rose high. More intense by the moment. While pushing the oar, I
looked at chị Điển holding her child, hair disheveled. The boy, up to this
point, still had enough milk, grinned and blew a kiss to me. Looking at him,
my heart swelled. My child, when you grow up and hear your parents describe
this scene, what will you think? Grow up to be a proud Vietnamese person.  
*“A ship!”*  
*“Then wave.”*

Honestly, no one was enthusiastic about signaling for help anymore. We had
seen over 50 ships. Two had come close to us then left. One had refused to
let us board, the others ignored us. The warmth and coldness of life. Anh
Tám, the most patient person, had also given up, sitting and looking at
the ship in the distance. Little Bình, too exhausted, lay stretched out,
waving a frail arm. We still rowed. Hiệu also held the small mirror,
blinking back and forth in a perfunctory manner. The beautifully painted
blue and white ship was cutting through the waves ahead of us.

Suddenly Anh Tám shouted:  
*“It stopped!”*  
*“What strength, keep rowing. Almost there.”*  
*“It really stopped! Its propeller slowed, the water isn't churning anymore. It
stopped!”*

He spoke as if out of breath, perhaps tired and hungry. It wasn't mealtime
yet. His voice made us somewhat believe it, and we looked at the ship before
us. It seemed to slow down. We looked closely. It really stopped, brothers!

It was 12:00 noon, May 18, 1978. We rowed with all our might. The
distance looked so close, yet why so far? Come on. Anh Bé held the rudder
steady. Everyone bustled. Anh Phúc seemed to wake up completely. Điển
shouted loudly, *“Let me swim!”* I had to shout, *“It's still far, wait a bit,”*
before Điển didn't jump. I took one oar, Anh Tư and his three sons took
three oars, trying to push the boat forward. I heard a shout, *“It dropped a
buoy!”* On that beautiful ship, the crew was clustered, and from the bridge,
a voice over the loudspeaker rang out, but no one understood a thing.
*“Japanese ship, I see the words Osaka - Sun Swallow.”*

*Én nhà trời* (Heavenly Swallow). *Thiên Nhạn*. I looked at the person
translating *Sun Swallow*. He translated it well. The ship *Sun Swallow*.
Anh Phúc and Điển hugged two plastic drums and jumped down, swimming toward
the buoy thrown by the ship. We continued to row with determination. Seeing
me panting and dripping with sweat, Chánh suddenly realized I had been
standing and rowing for too long. Chánh said:

*“Let me row. You go handle the business.”*

Business? What did I know how to do at this hour?

Chiến held his small child, two streams of tears flowing down his face. Oanh
sobbed, calling out, *“Mommy! Mommy!”* Chị Điển held her child, leaning
against the cabin wall, her face pale. Chị Lan, looking disheveled, waved
her hand. Mr. Thông affirmed, *“This time, we are definitely saved!”* I
nodded. Hiệu told me, *“If they don't save us, I'll jump into the sea and
commit suicide. You try to escape, remember to tell everyone. I die to awaken
the conscience of those stone-hearted captains.”* I nodded again. Nghi and
Nam stood ready with a rope.

Anh Phúc and Điển swam with all their might. Though he jumped into the
water later, Điển arrived first. Anh Phúc seemed utterly exhausted but also
managed to reach the ladder. We saw Điển being helped up, followed by Anh
Phúc. Điển recounted later that as soon as he boarded, he could only say
one word, *“Water,”* before fainting immediately. The sailors gave him a drink
of something he guessed was mint-flavored. He woke up instantly and requested
rescue. The captain asked if there were guns; he shook his head vigorously:

*“No gun, no explosive!”*

As soon as the captain agreed to rescue them, Điển *“came back to life,”*
running out to wave at us. Four oars were still churning the water. On the
boat, the crying sounded like a funeral, especially when Điển appeared
and raised his hand to wave. The sailors on the ship also bustled about,
running back and forth. They lowered the gangway low to wait. Gradually,
we managed to bring the boat close to the ship. Just then, Oanh fainted and
fell against me. I held the girl, looking at the scene of my boat approaching
the foot of the ladder. I shouted loudly:

*“One person at a time! Help the women and children.”*

They showed discipline, helping each other climb slowly.

I carried Oanh on my shoulder. Upon reaching the deck, I collapsed. Everyone
was given water immediately. Perhaps Điển had spoken of our needs
beforehand. Captain Kim Do Yung personally helped me up. He asked me if it
was possible to scuttle the boat. He explained that letting it drift was very
dangerous for other ships, and besides, it was about to sink anyway. I agreed
immediately. He asked if I wanted to take anything else from the boat. I
shook my head. He personally went down to our boat, and a moment later,
came back up. The boat was pushed away. The bow pointed high into the air,
the stern sinking slowly down. The scrap of cassock serving as a yellow sail
still puffed up, stubbornly catching the wind. About five minutes later, our
beloved small boat sank deep into the heart of the ocean. We were rescued
241 nautical miles northeast of Singapore at 1:00 p.m. on May 18, 1978,
and were taken by the ship *Sun Swallow* to Chiba, Japan, seven days later,
on May 25, 1978.

**Gratitude**

The final part of this account is dedicated to thanking Captain Kim Do
Yung and the entire crew of the *Sun Swallow*. Without the chivalry of that
venerable captain and his entire crew, we would have died in the middle of
the ocean. The moment they saw us in such a wretched state at sea, they knew
we were Vietnamese fleeing Communism. They were also aware of the procedures
established by Southeast Asian nations and many other places, which would
land them in troubles sometimes costing them their jobs. Yet, they stopped
the ship to pick us up immediately after asking the company for permission.

I wish to record here the statement read by Chị Nguyễn Hữu Điển at
the farewell party the captain and crew held for us the day before we went
ashore. This also serves as the conclusion to this writing.

*“... We have overcome all perils and hardships to seek Freedom. You are the
ones who helped us escape. When you stopped your ship, you surely knew the
troubles that would befall you, but out of human kindness, you allowed us
to board this *Sun Swallow*. We found Freedom from the very first moment we
set foot on this ship. Our remaining duty in the days to come is to struggle
for the freedom of our compatriots and flesh and blood currently living in
Vietnam. Whenever, wherever, we will keep this in mind and proclaim it to
our descendants...”*
