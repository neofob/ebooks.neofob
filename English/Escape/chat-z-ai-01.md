Nguyễn Hữu Hiệu had to report to the police weekly. Nguyễn Hữu
Điển, though already 33 years old, suddenly received a summons for a health
examination for military induction. Brother Tám was in hiding. I was under
surveillance by the police, summoned by the Cultural Office, and threatened
by the militia in all sorts of ways. Phúc had signed a pledge that if he
attempted to escape by sea, he would accept the death penalty. Bằng was
also without a household registration booklet... They were merely writers,
journalists, professors, and printshop workers... but all were considered
reactionary because of things from the distant past. The translation of
*Doctor Zhivago* had earned Hiệu a year in prison. Thiệp had worked for
*Chính Luận*, a newspaper considered pro-American and extreme right-wing,
which had once engaged in a war of words and challenged the Viet Cong military
mission to a public debate. Furthermore, he had many connections with the
"extremist" group *Sóng Thần*, and was the General Secretary of the
War Correspondents Association. The Cultural Protection Agency as well as
the City Committee had repeatedly "advised" him "to live properly." Điển
worked for *Sóng Thần*, a newspaper the Communists hated. In short, these
gatherings could easily land us in prison. There was always some nonsensical
topic raised as a pretext. "Today we discuss bicycle prices. Let's discuss
what to bring when moving to the New Economic Zone." Suddenly, the police
would burst in, dragging each person to a corner and demanding a recount
of what the three of us had discussed. If the statements didn't match,
there was trouble. The result of these discussions led to the idea of going
through the Rừng Sát waterways. Phước Hòa was located on the highway,
20 kilometers from Vũng Tàu, bordering the vast Rừng Sát with its trees
and a tangled river system. This area had been a resistance base against the
French, then a stronghold for the Bình Xuyên, and a recuperation area for
the Communists. The canals and creeks spread like a spiderweb. Unfamiliar
with the terrain, getting lost in Rừng Sát was like stepping into Zhuge
Liang’s Eight Trigrams Formation.

Since April 30, 1975, Saigon no longer had coal-fired stoves. Nor coal. The
state did not permit private individuals to build charcoal kilns. The
Communists boasted that the Hòn Gay coal mine was incredibly large, ranking
first in the world. "Fruit-shaped" coal briquettes were produced recklessly;
even if the entire North used them, there would still be a surplus. Our
compatriots in the South would have fruit-shaped coal, both convenient
and cheap, with no need for mangrove charcoal anymore. That pie-in-the-sky
promise of fruit-shaped coal actually came true. Each person was allowed
to buy 4 kilograms of coal per month, though some months the state also
"forgot." The coal was mixed with so much soil that the briquettes would
crumble into piles before they could even be grasped. When buying, state
employees would add water to the coal so it could be molded, but this further
reduced the actual weight of the coal.

Rừng Sát suddenly became a lifeline for a number of people. Boats from
Saigon streamed into Rừng Sát; every day, hundreds of firewood boats
returned to Saigon. Any tree was chopped down—Mam, Xu, Bằng Lăng,
Date Palm...

After three years under the regime, Rừng Sát was so devastated and desolate
that birds had nowhere to perch, and monkeys had no place to shelter. One
could not find a Xu tree or a Mam tree thicker than a calf anymore. Now,
people had to resort to scavenging, chopping the remaining stumps that had
been felled over the past three years.

Officially, the state did not permit firewood cutting to protect the
forests. Forest products were the property of the regime. Everyone knew
this, especially the militia. And whenever they lacked pocket money or
drinking money, they simply had to stop boats along the Lòng Tảo River,
confiscate the "illegal" firewood, and sell it to line their own pockets. For
the sake of a meal, the poor people—whom the regime boasted were the "core
element"—still had to plunge into Rừng Sát to chop wood, enduring the
occasional confiscation by the militia. Many bloody tragedies occurred. A
father and son brought salted fish, broken rice, and soy sauce down to the
forest to chop wood for half a month, filling a boat. Upon reaching Tam Tông
Hiệp, they were stopped by the militia and their cargo confiscated. The
father grabbed an axe, chopped off the head of a militia man trying to rob
him of his meager sustenance, and then committed suicide on the spot. One
did not argue or plead with the militia. A militia man with an AK-47
on his shoulder spoke as the regime spoke; his orders were the Party's
orders. Any police officer, any militiaman of just sixteen years of age,
could play the role of a judge. A mere police station chief could send you
to prison for life. They were hailed by the state as servants of the people,
the spearhead of the regime, the bastion of the glorious Communist Party
of Vietnam. They were exploited to the maximum, working day and night for
a salary insufficient to buy 10 kilograms of free-market rice. They had
to live off "perks" to serve effectively, and the state, intentionally,
created many opportunities for them to have these perks. The woodcutters
knew this, so even if their wood was stolen brazenly, they dared not react,
knowing that cutting wood like this classified them as "parasitic elements
refusing direct production," not to mention the crime of sabotaging forest
products and harming the "strength and labor" of the people. The militia
also knew not to be too harsh, confiscating only enough that the people
could continue cutting wood—meaning roughly one out of four trips. They
had to let the people linger and survive so there would be a place to extort.

In that case, Rừng Sát might just be worth it!

I decided to go down to the forest.

I managed to buy a dilapidated sampan at an exorbitant price. Why would
a pale-faced scholar like me buy a boat? People's Police were swarming
everywhere; a single slip-up meant handcuffs. The boat was bought "as
is," practically a wreck that couldn't be used immediately and had to be
repaired. Thanks to that, I met Tư Nhiễn.

While repairing the boat, he chatted happily. He also had two sons currently
chopping wood in Rừng Sát. His family had two boats. I hesitated. Could
this man be trusted? In a society like Vietnam today, anyone could be the
eyes and ears of the regime. There were all sorts of organizations, from the
Red Scarf Youth to the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth. From "advanced women"
to labor unions, party cells, and the Red Flag, the state planted people
everywhere. Anyone could turn you in to prison or a re-education camp. The
regime had reached the pinnacle of success in making you see the state's
eyes and ears wherever you looked, leaving you with the constant sensation
of being watched. There were cases where children denounced their parents to
be exceptionally admitted to the Party, and wives denounced their husbands
to be publicly praised before the masses. So, should I trust Tư Nhiễn?

A native of Tân An, Vĩnh Long, a veteran of the old regime, he was a
true laborer. Carpenter, boatbuilder, fisherman, woodcutter, farmer—he
could do it all. With a few gold teeth, a short stature that made him walk
with a slight waddle, slow but steady, he was a man of few words, prone
to smiling, and smoked a pipe incessantly. With a wife and six children,
he worked but never had enough to eat because he was not entitled to buy
rice at the official state price. State rice was only 40 xu per kilogram,
while the black market price was 4 to 6 đồng—ten times more expensive.

His two eldest sons had completed their health examinations but didn't
know when they would have to report for military service. Well, I just had
to try. I invited Tư Nhiễn to go cut wood with me, offering him a share
that was rather too generous, on top of all expenses which I would cover. He
cheerfully agreed immediately. Later, he told me:

"It wasn't for the profit that I agreed to go down to the forest with you that
first time. I felt there was something strange about it, so I went to see what
it was about. To be honest, I thought you were working for the Puppet regime."

"Puppet" meant wicked, something usurping and illegitimate. The Communists
claimed they followed the orthodox path and, simply put, labeled everything
belonging to the Republic of Vietnam as "Puppet." Puppet Army, Puppet
Authority, Puppet People.

At first, Southerners were uncomfortable being called Puppet. Gradually,
after clashes with Communist cadres and seeing the true nature of the regime
and the Party, everyone accepted the word "Puppet" with pride. Anything
that seemed superior, anything to be proud of... was immediately labeled
"That's Puppet!" Some even claimed "Puppet" as their surname, for instance,
"I am Puppet Văn Thiệp."

And so, one afternoon in March, I followed Tư Nhiễn down to the
forest. Seeing me groping my way down to the foot of Rạch Ông bridge, Tư
Nhiễn smiled with satisfaction. I must have been a sight. A broad-brimmed
hat, a gray khaki shirt faded from wear with a frayed collar and patched
elbows, and messy trousers. He critiqued:

"It'll take a few more days before you look the part, you're too pale!"

Departing from Rạch Ông bridge, the boat took a shortcut via the Đìa Creek
through Phú Xuân. We were equipped with a 4-horsepower Kohler long-tail
motor. Going alone with a long-tail motor, it would take 10 hours to reach
the woodcutting site. I listened attentively to the new place names:

"We'll go along the Lòng Tảo River, reach the Đồng Tranh junction,
pass through Tắc Hông, Ba Đọi, Tắc Cua, Cù Lao Ông Tượng, the
Bàn Thạch intersection, and the Ông Trịnh River before reaching the
workplace." At my request, Tư Nhiễn anchored the boat at Phú Xuân to
buy rice, fish sauce, dried fish, and pipe tobacco, then we went to a coffee
shop to sip and wait for the tide to turn. Firewood boats arrived noisily,
bringing dark, swarthy faces that grew more numerous by the moment. There
were men sitting silently at the bow of their boats, staring broodingly at the
water. There were women with cracked hands and feet, draped in thick, heavily
patched clothing, sitting motionless in the hold like soulless logs. At dusk,
the boat convoy pulled up. It was a boat equipped with a 20-horsepower Diesel
engine. The smaller boats were tied together into a long string trailing
behind the big boat. The fee was between 3 and 6 đồng depending on the
boat size. And so, that night, I lay curled up in the hold, listening to
the sound of water slapping against the hull as the crowd towed us away.

Cutting wood was no joke; it was maximum labor, an arduous task. Saltwater
trees like Xu, Đước, and Mam all grew in mud. When the tide rose,
the trees were submerged, and when the water receded, the roots were fully
exposed like octopus tentacles planted densely into the mud.

The axe Tư Nhiễn handed me was heavy. We waded and splashed through the
mud. The roots were like caltrops pointing skyward. My feet stung from the
sharp stubble. Fiddler crabs and gobies stared with bulging eyes. Mud covered
my entire body. The saltwater and the March sun turned me red as a boiled
shrimp. I had hundreds of scratches, and the salt water seeped in with a
stinging, numbing pain.

I dared not show fatigue, even though my hands were falling apart and my
legs wanted to buckle. Tư Nhiễn looked at me and smiled now and then:

"You look like a schoolteacher. Do you think you can cut wood?"

"If you can do it, I can do it."

We found a moderately sized Bằng Lăng tree. The two of us toiled all
morning, chopping and hacking. Tư Nhiễn's axe strokes went true and sweet,
while mine slipped and missed.

Tư Nhiễn had brought a small net, so when the water was mid-tide, we cast
it. Rừng Sát was truly amazing. In just a short while, we caught a basket
of shrimp. I wanted to catch more, but he said:

"Don't waste Heaven's gifts. This is enough; let the fish and shrimp
live. There are people coming after us, too!"

This simple statement moved me and made me trust him completely. It didn't
make sense that a man who respected the right to live of shrimp could betray
his friends, even if it was just the honor among wanderers. That night,
after sharing a few puffs of bitter pipe tobacco with him, I expressed my
true intention. He also confided in me. It turned out we were the same. In
the end, I was just like him; we only wanted to be human in the most ordinary
sense. Surely he didn't know about the United Nations, Secretary-General
Waldheim, the Declaration of Human Rights, or the Human Rights Committee. He
certainly didn't have a clear consciousness of freedom of thought, freedom of
speech, or freedom to choose a profession. He didn't think about those things,
whereas for me, they were luxuries, like atomic bombs or proton bombs to a
small, weak nation. But he, like me, deep in our hearts, demanded the right
to a genuine life, and we had been refused, stripped of it. A minority,
tightly organized, armed to the teeth, and indoctrinated with an amoral
theory that inverted morality, had stolen the lives from his hands and mine,
from the hands of 50 million Vietnamese people.

The final weapon for people like him, like me, was refusal. The UN Charter and
the Constitutions of nations were remiss in not recording therein the right
of the individual to refuse participation. So, we’re leaving, right, brother
