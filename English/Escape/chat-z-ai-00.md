**Plans**

Tư Nhiễn’s face, naturally dark and swarthy, seemed to darken further in
the night shadows of Rừng Sát. He lay curled up in the cramped hold of the
small boat, hugging his knees, incessantly puffing on a pipe. For the past
few days, we had been chopping wood until we were drained. He spoke slowly:

“Talking like that proves you trust me. I’ve been thinking I can’t live
under these people anymore, either. It’s not just working with nothing
to show for it; I feel like I’m not living a human life. I agree to go
with you.”

I felt a sudden sense of relief and laughed. “If luck fails us, it’s
off to jail.”

“Good grief, living like this right now is far worse than being in prison.”

From that day on, Tư Nhiễn threw himself into the plot to escape the
Communist regime—a scheme calculated and executed amidst a dense network
of police and secret agents, a scheme we had spent an entire year fumbling
with to no avail.

The story began in April 1977.

Chiến, a courageous young man, had come from Saigon to a remote
village—Phước Hòa, located 20 kilometers from Vũng Tàu—with the
clear intention of buying a boat to escape by sea. He had taken the first
step, purchasing a long boat, 11 meters in length and about 3 meters wide,
equipped with a 20-horsepower Diesel engine. But he could not do it alone;
he lacked the manpower and had to seek out accomplices.

One could not simply take a boat and sail out to sea. The boat was allowed
to carry a maximum of 100 liters of fuel, 10 kilograms of food, and 50
liters of water. The police inspected frequently. If these limits were
exceeded, the heavy penalty was confiscation of the boat; the light penalty
was a temporary ban on fishing. Anyone stepping onto a boat was placed
under surveillance. Militiamen swarmed the pier, snooping and peering
about. There was no feasible plan. We looked at one another and sighed,
while the state’s apparatus tightened its grip by the day. Going anywhere
required permission. Upon arrival, one had to report in. Anyone could be
summoned by the police to the station for intimidation and interrogation.

Everyone lived in a daze. The boat went out fishing every day, but the
losses were terrible. A liter of diesel cost only 20 xu at the official
rate, but on the black market in Phước Hòa, it rose to 2 đồng. A
single fishing trip consumed at least 60 đồng, while the state forced us
to sell fish to the cooperative for 60 xu per kilogram for small fish and
1.5 đồng for large ones. At the market, a kilogram of small fish cost 6
đồng, while large fish or choice shrimp went for up to 12 đồng. We had
to either grit our teeth and endure the absurdity or abandon the trade. If
we abandoned the trade, we would have to sell the boat back to the state at
1/20th of its real value. That was likely the state’s ultimate goal. And
so, we gritted our teeth and endured, for the sake of other objectives.

The boat, made of fragile Bằng Lăng wood planks only 2.5 centimeters
thick, began to rot after just a few months of operation. Chiến had to
request permission to bring the boat to Saigon for repairs after bribing
Bảy Lọt, the head of security, 500 đồng. The moment this opportunity
arose, a new suggestion was put forward: We would leave from Saigon. But
the state’s campaign to crush the bourgeoisie made this impossible. The
web of police and secret agents flooded the streets, guarding every nook
and cranny. Vehicles were stopped and searched incessantly. Traveling
from Phú Nhuận to Bến Thành Market could result in being stopped
for interrogation a dozen times. How could we transport supplies, food,
and fuel to the boat? We had to return to Phước Hòa... The group met
again to discuss back and forth. This was incredibly dangerous because most
of us already had suspended sentences hanging over our heads.
