**The Sun Swallow**

May 16. The brothers decided to rig a sail. Anh Tư tied three scarves and
Hiệu’s yellow cassock together to form a large sail. A gentle breeze blew,
and the fabric puffed out.

"It's moving, Anh Tư!"
"Pull up the anchor!"
"We're almost to shore, Anh Tư!"

In reality, the boat probably wasn't moving, or was moving very
slowly. Strictly speaking, it was just drifting, but everyone was happy. I
heard Bằng at the bow softly reciting:

*"The sea is endless, what does direction matter?*
*Oh boat, I beg you, dock at a lonely shore."*

It was a poem by the poet Vũ Hoàng Chương that we had learned from
Teacher Ý back at Chu Văn An. I looked at Bằng:
"Hey, do you remember Mr. Trần Đình Ý?"

Suddenly, we seemed to disdain all our troubles. The women and girls vied
to sit out by the stern to scoop water for baths. The children took turns
splashing water over each other's heads. The sun rose higher. Belongings
that had been soaked for days were brought out to dry. The scene on the ship
looked like a refugee camp. No one was sad. Nam, sitting by the side of the
boat, suddenly cried out:
"A snake!"

A small but long sea snake, black back, pale yellow belly, was swimming
leisurely in the blue water.
"If you meet a snake, you go; if you meet a turtle, you return. We’ll
definitely get there. Trust me."

Everyone believed Nam. Perhaps that miraculous optimism helped us escape
death. Besides, dying here was joyful too. Giant flying fish leaped up and
down before the bow, giving us a free show.

The sea was fairly calm. If we had enough food and water, drifting like this
forever would be delightful. But the harsh reality was that we were hungry and
thirsty. We couldn't afford to waste anything. I instructed Thái carefully:
be resolute, issue only the exact ration regulated. Let the children cry;
it couldn't be helped. I looked at Anh Phúc's lips, dry and cracked,
my heart aching. I looked at Đàn, seeming about to faint, not knowing
what to say. Brother! Sister! For freedom, we had to leave our homeland;
to live a human life, we had to go. To go was to accept everything. Dying
in the middle of the sea was joyful too. I leaned against the boat’s
side. Little Oanh mumbled prayers to the Virgin Mary. A moment later, Oanh
burst into tears. I was surprised:
"What is it?"

"Now I miss my mom. Before, she took care of everything. Now..."
"Nonsense. Look how many uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters are here. What
do you want?"
"I miss my mom."
"I miss my mom too. My mother is now a lonely old soul. She spoiled me
too. But my mother had to let me go. Your mother accepted your leaving
too. Those mothers love their children so much, yet they had to grit their
teeth and watch them go. We must be worthy of that sacrifice. Fight on,
Oanh. Cheer up. If Oanh is happy, Mom is happy at home."

That night, stomach hungry, mouth thirsty, we gazed at the stars in the
sky. Large ships traveled back and forth busily. We lit a fire to signal
for help, but in vain. Anh Tư lay stretched out beside me.
"That's the Plough. That cluster is the Pleiades. That hazy spot over there
is Khuê Star."
*"Nine Khuê stars lie side by side,*
*Loving you since mother returned to father."*
"Thinking about it, the ancients were really smooth talkers, huh?"
"I don't know about smooth talking. My old man said if I was to get married,
I got married. No flirting involved. But I miss her now. Decades of living
together, yet I had to leave. Really. Why didn't you take a wife with you?"
"Every one of them is stuck back there, Anh Tư!"

We lay there sharing bits and pieces of our thoughts, and I drifted into a
light sleep. Early the next morning, Anh Tư woke me. The sail hung limp
without wind, sorrowfully. The sea had light waves. The boat bobbed like
a cork, motionless. The sun hadn't risen yet, but the east was already
bright. Surely today would be sunny again. I worried about the remaining
water. Anh Tư hugged his knees and looked at me:
"What's the plan? We can't just leave it like this, can we? Last night,
not a single ship paid attention to us."
"Stay calm, Anh Tư, we're almost to shore."

Chánh and Nam crawled over to me.
"We have to do something."

I called everyone over and said:
"We are in a tight spot. The hope of being rescued by a ship is too faint. Does
anyone have an idea?"
"Make a net to catch fish. Yesterday I saw fish behind the boat. Having fish
to eat would help a lot," Hiệu suggested.
"I suggest writing a distress message and dropping it into the sea."

We executed both ideas. The distress note was written in English, roughly
stating that 48 people escaping the Communist hell were in a desperate
situation, without water, without food, and with a broken engine. We tied
the distress letters to plastic barrels and dropped them into the sea. Six
were sent off.

While I was busy with Anh Phúc writing the distress letters, there were
cheers from the rear. A school of fish had gotten caught in the net. In total,
we caught 37 fish the size of two fingers. Estimated at nearly a kilo. Besides
that, there was one as big as a wrist with faint stripes. After deliberation,
the brothers agreed to cook fish porridge. Each person got nearly a bowl. I
sipped it slowly. Never had a bowl of porridge tasted so good. The porridge
was sweet, soaking into my heart, liver, spleen, and lungs. A little boy
brought his bowl in to ask for more. Everyone laughed. It's all gone, not
even the bones are left.

That was the only school of foolish fish to swim into our tiny net. The
official fishing net on the boat had to be thrown away right when we passed
the Cần Giờ lighthouse. This tiny piece of net was brought by the group
from the forest, originally just a hand net for catching shrimp in the river
shallows. No one believed it would be so useful.

The joy from the fish didn't last long because the sun grew more intense by
the hour. Hiệu and Nam found me:
"Why not build a raft? Send an envoy; maybe we'll escape."
These two suggested using four plastic barrels tied together, and they
would go, hoping to meet a rescue ship or find an island. They only asked
for two packs of noodles and half a liter of water per person. I asked for
the brothers' opinions. No one agreed. Live together, die together. Hiệu
and Nam insisted on executing the plan but were not allowed.

Anh Tư pondered, then pulled me aside:
"I'll speak to you privately, then you ask everyone. Is it right to die so
unreasonably like this? Why don't we break some planks to make oars? If we
keep rowing, we must reach shore, right?"
"Can a boat this size be rowed?"
"If not, we row anyway! We have to do something."

The will to live is truly terrifying. I stared at Anh Tư. The sea sun had
turned him swarthy like a black bronze statue. His chin was square, exuding
determination. Even worms and ants want to live, let alone humans.
"Let's do it, Anh Tư."

Everyone gathered to find a way to make oars. I was clumsy and ignorant of
this type of work, so I was allowed to go up to watch for ships to signal
for help. I laughed at Anh Phúc's comment regarding the indifference of
the large ships: "Truly, the way of the world." An intellectual like him
couldn't speak harshly of anyone. The ships still went back and forth in
all directions. I asked Hiệu:
"Counted how many yet?"
"At least 43, not counting the ones too far away that we skipped."
"What were the names of the ships that passed nearby this morning?"

Picking up chị Lan's tiny vanity mirror, I asked:
"How do you signal SOS?"
"Three short – three long – three short."

A ship passed on the left. I flashed the mirror. Hiệu used a white flag to
wave frantically. Two or three others took turns waving. The ship was big,
white, elegant in shape, cutting the waves beautifully. White foam spread
from the bow down both sides. The ship showed no sign of caring about us
and kept its old course. The weather gradually cooled, then darkness fell
without me noticing. I went down to find Anh Tư:
"Are the oars done?"
"Almost. Tomorrow morning, six oarsmen, why worry about not reaching shore?"

The wind blew lightly, enough to puff out the large sail. I leaned back
beside little Tí. The boy had lost a lot of weight, his cheeks no longer
chubby. I smiled, but he didn't smile back like usual. I silently looked
at the little face, thinking of terrifying images. Thái had announced that
the water was only enough to hold out for one more day. If hunger and thirst
struck, surely the children would die first. There have been fathers who ate
their children. Would I... I looked at the boy lying limp, shaking my head,
not daring to think further.

Since morning, each person had received a half-bowl of porridge and a sip of
water. My throat was dry, my voice hoarse. I swallowed saliva continuously
and coaxed myself to sleep. The night finally passed. We had been drifting
for over a week and still didn't know where fate would drift us. Strangely,
not a single person on the boat was worried or afraid. Since dawn, Tư
Nhiễn had been rallying everyone. In total, only 4 oars were finished, so
we agreed to divide into 4 shifts. Each person rowed for half an hour. Cang
and Tư Nhiễn had to instruct for a while before we rowed correctly.
"Hey! Is the boat moving?"
"Moving fiercely. Come on, brothers. Rowing like medieval slaves is good
enough."

It was a joke Tư Nhiễn heard. The brothers laughed and rowed harder. Those
whose turn it hadn't come yet had to crawl into the hold to avoid sweating. We
took turns rowing, leaning the oars together, lunging forward for momentum,
leaning back lightly, pushing like professional oarsmen. The boat seemed to
be moving. But more importantly, we were fighting. The sea was beautiful but
deadly because of the sun. We had to pour water continuously onto the deck,
fighting against the terrible thirst. Thái accurately reported we had nearly
60 liters of water left, 40 packs of noodles, and half a kilo of sugar. Not
enough for one meal for 48 people.

I instructed Thái repeatedly to be resolute in issuing rations. Two caps
of water a day. Four people per pack of noodles. If we could maintain this,
we could fight for another 4 days and nights. I also hoped it would rain.
"Hang in there, we're almost there, brothers!"

There was a dragonfly. We looked in surprise at that tiny brown creature. Why
was it here? I asked Anh Bé, the most authoritative among us. He shook his
head. Either he didn't know if there were dragonflies at sea, or perhaps
there was a desert island nearby. Nevertheless, that tiny creature instilled
excitement in us.

Around 9 a.m. that day, a heavy Night Heron landed on the bow. Hiệu was
sitting nearby, staring blankly. The heron, perhaps surprised by the cluttered
scene, nodded its head then flapped its wings and flew. The brothers shouted:
"Why didn't you grab it?"
"Poor thing. It looked so tired."

Ah, another pitiful soul, unwilling to kill even a small creature. Nam
regretted it terribly. That heron would have fed us for a day. Everyone
laughed. The heron was quite large, flapping its wings slowly, flying
north. Hiệu deduced:
"The heron flies slowly and can't fly far. Definitely near shore. Come on,
brothers!"

I remembered the lines from *Teng Wang Ge* and never found them as beautiful
as now:
*"Wild ducks and lone gulls fly together,*
*Autumn water and the vast sky share one color."*

The sun still rose high. More intense by the moment. While pushing the oar, I
looked at chị Điển holding her child, hair disheveled. The boy, up to this
point, still had enough milk, grinned and blew a kiss to me. Looking at him,
my heart swelled. My child, when you grow up and hear your parents describe
this scene, what will you think? Grow up to be a proud Vietnamese person.
"A ship!"
"Then wave."

Honestly, no one was enthusiastic about signaling for help anymore. We had
seen over 50 ships. Two had come close to us then left. One had refused to
let us board, the others ignored us. The warmth and coldness of life. Anh
Tám, the most patient person, had also given up, sitting and looking at
the ship in the distance. Little Bình, too exhausted, lay stretched out,
waving a frail arm. We still rowed. Hiệu also held the small mirror,
blinking back and forth in a perfunctory manner. The beautifully painted
blue and white ship was cutting through the waves ahead of us.

Suddenly Anh Tám shouted:
"It stopped!"
"What strength, keep rowing. Almost there."
"It really stopped! Its propeller slowed, the water isn't churning anymore. It
stopped!"

He spoke as if out of breath, perhaps tired and hungry. It wasn't mealtime
yet. His voice made us somewhat believe it, and we looked at the ship before
us. It seemed to slow down. We looked closely. It really stopped, brothers!

It was 12:00 noon, May 18, 1978. We rowed with all our might. The
distance looked so close, yet why so far? Come on. Anh Bé held the rudder
steady. Everyone bustled. Anh Phúc seemed to wake up completely. Điển
shouted loudly, "Let me swim!" I had to shout, "It's still far, wait a bit,"
before Điển didn't jump. I took one oar, Anh Tư and his three sons took
three oars, trying to push the boat forward. I heard a shout, "It dropped a
buoy!" On that beautiful ship, the crew was clustered, and from the bridge,
a voice over the loudspeaker rang out, but no one understood a thing.
"Japanese ship, I see the words Osaka - Sun Swallow."

*Én nhà trời* (Heavenly Swallow). *Thiên Nhạn*. I looked at the person
translating *Sun Swallow*. He translated it well. The ship *Sun Swallow*.
