**Preparation**

The nearest target was Singapore, 600 nautical miles from Vũng Tàu. Thus,
we needed a minimum of 600 liters of fuel, based on the estimate that our
boat's speed was 6 knots—an estimation method I had picked up from a captain:
throw an object off the bow and count how many seconds it takes to reach the
stern. Divide 10 by the number of seconds to get the speed in knots. After
repeating this several times, Chiến reported the speed was 6 knots.

To be honest, our means were extremely tight. Even the oldest nautical chart
cost at least 3,000 đồng and was hard to find. I scoured everywhere but
only managed to buy a military compass and a helicopter compass.

Saigon was dying a slow death; it was truly hard to find anything. I spent
an entire day just to buy 2 kilograms of nails for Tư Nhiễn at ten
times the normal price. There were no planks to be had, so I pried up the
floorboards of my house to get wood to repair the small boats. Wherever
I went, I saw sorrowful faces and incessant head-shaking. The state had
conducted inventories and sealed everything off; there was no more buying
or selling. No one was foolish enough to sell to you, for there were too
many reasons to suspect that you were just a People's Policeman on a probe,
ready to confiscate all their assets, drag them to the police station,
and send them to a re-education camp. No one trusted anyone anymore.

In such circumstances, 600 liters of oil was a major problem. Right at the
Phước Hòa dock, a boat was only allowed to keep 100 liters. After much
calculation, Chiến said he would find every way to hide fuel so that we
could have 200 liters on board the day of departure. That meant I had to
scrounge up 400 liters. On the black market, I could still buy it at five
or six times the official price, sold by cadres stealing from the state. The
difficulty was transporting the oil down to the boat. Just carrying 10 liters
on the road could get you stopped and questioned. Three days before we were
to leave, our plan almost blew up because of the oil.

Using two Honda motorcycles, the four of us transported 80 liters of oil from
Saigon to the Rạch Ông area to transfer to a sampan where Tư Nhiễn
was waiting. This was a reckless act, but there was no other solution. I
went first, carrying Nguyễn Phúc. Nguyễn Tiến Hoài followed behind,
carrying Chiến’s wife, chị Nhung. We made it past almost all the
checkpoints, thanks to the twilight hour when the streets were most crowded,
until the last checkpoint, about a kilometer from the boat.

I had just slipped through when I heard a whistle shriek. I gunned the engine
and sped off. Hoài, following behind, was slower— as he recounted later—
and decided to ride calmly as if he hadn't heard the whistle. About two
minutes later, a police vehicle caught up and forced him to the curb. Phúc,
sitting behind me, whispered, "Hoài’s been nabbed." I didn't answer;
I sped up, quickly transferred two cans of oil, and pushed Phúc down into
the boat. Tư Nhiễn paddled, and a moment later, the small boat bobbed in
the middle of the river.

Hoài and chị Nhung were taken to the ward police station. Both had agreed
beforehand to insist that they were smuggling oil for the first time. They
were grilled incessantly for four hours. I was burning with anxiety, pacing
back and forth beside a roadside water stall. If something happened, what
would we do? Sacrifice them? Postpone? But they were released, losing only
the two cans of oil. The police didn't write up a report; surely those two
cans would be sold on the black market for drinking money. Corruption in
every form was tacitly approved under the regime. Only through that could
Party cadres live to serve.

The preparations grew more tense by the moment.

Right then, another figure appeared: Mr. Nguyễn Văn Thông. Mr. Thông
was formerly the owner of a large printing house where my newspaper had its
printing done. Back then, we met daily, greeting each other and exchanging
necessary pleasantries. That day, as I was calculating the payment for
boat repairs in the yard, Mr. Thông arrived. Perhaps out of sensitivity,
or seeing my swarthy, disheveled appearance, Mr. Thông guessed. He pulled
me aside to the riverbank and whispered, "Let me go with you."

My eyes went wide. He spoke softly, very quickly, but clearly:

"I’ll be frank so you don't worry. You’ve known me for a long time. My
printing machinery was confiscated clean. I planned to skip town, so I bought
a 'single-block' boat. If you go, let me follow in my boat."

Another person who didn't want to live the life of a beast. I probed:

"A 'single-block' boat? How can that make the trip?"

Mr. Thông answered decisively:

"My engine is a 12-horsepower Yue Long. My boat is 8 meters long, 2 meters
wide; formerly a river cargo boat, recently converted to a fishing boat. I
know that going with a boat like that means nine deaths to one life. But
better to die cool in the middle of the ocean."

A responsible father planning to take his nearly 10 children—the youngest
not yet 4 years old—1,300 kilometers across the sea in an 8-meter boat,
even though he was no seaman and knew full well the dangers. That was the
reality. The father did not want his children to grow up in an education system
that taught only suspicion, spying, reporting, and violence, so he was ready
to drag his children into the realm of death so that he might see his children
remain his children, remain people who spoke straight and lived honestly.

Mr. Thông left behind assets accumulated through years of sweat and labor,
but in truth, he was luckier than most of the others going, who had to leave
behind parents, wives, children, and siblings.

Mr. Thông’s family was accepted into the operation because with an
8-meter boat, transporting oil, people, and food down to the forest was
easier. Moreover, the family had Thái and Chánh, sturdy young men familiar
with the waterways and the Rừng Sát area, where they had been fishing
for months. Both were non-commissioned officers in the Republic of Vietnam
Armed Forces.

Besides fuel for the engines, there was food for the people. I planned to bring
100 kilos of rice, a bin of crushed noodles, a bin of dried bread, candy,
sugar, and powdered milk for the small children. Finding these things was a
struggle; getting them down to the forest was a thousand times harder. Even
so, everything was taking shape more clearly.

I held in my hand a small flotilla consisting of Mr. Thông’s large
"single-block" boat, which had a legal berth at Phú Xuân; two boats belonging
to Tư Nhiễn, also legal thanks to registration; and three illegal boats,
including one with a 5-horsepower diesel engine which by habit we called an F-4
boat, and two small boats equipped with Kohler engines. On paper, it sounded
quite impressive, but it was fraught with danger. Tư Nhiễn grimaced at me:

"How is this going to work? The whole bunch will die. I can’t handle five
boats alone. The ward police already called me in; I told them the boats
were brought in for repairs. The neighbors are snooping around a lot already."

I, too, was frantic. The oil, bought in 10-liter increments, wasn't enough. Anh
Bé, who would be our captain, was still stuck at the labor site and hadn't
returned.

After two cups of strong coffee, an idea suddenly flashed in my mind.

"How about we let them float?"

Tư Nhiễn looked at me in surprise. I chuckled at my journalistic phrasing
and explained:

"Can you and the two boys take the boats out of the dock and wander on the
river for a week? If you dock in a different place each time, surely it’ll
be okay."

Tư Nhiễn nodded:

"A week might just work; any longer and it’s difficult. I can’t guarantee
it."

And so, now here, now there, the father and his two sons took the fleet of
five boats drifting all over the Tân Thuận, Cầu Hàng, Rạch Đía,
Phú Xuân, Phú Khánh areas. We played spy games. We set a specific time to
meet at a certain location. If there was an obstacle and someone didn't show
up 15 minutes after the set time, we would meet an hour later at a second
location, and if they still couldn't make it, it meant they were nabbed. And
so it went. Tư Nhiễn on the river, me running on the bank. Living in the
claws of the Communists, one had to be careful. Once, I escaped thanks to
being prepared.

On a reconnaissance mission to scout a fuel hiding spot, I was stopped and
questioned by border police. They demanded to see papers. Liễn, Tư Nhiễn's
son, and I claimed we were going woodcutting and didn't bring papers for
fear of losing them. They asked for our woodcutting tools; I pulled out two
iron-handled axes and a machete. They looked at our miserable faces and waved
us on. Every time I went down to the forest, I also bought a little wood to
bring back, pretending I was really doing business. Back in Saigon, I sold it
to recoup the capital. Because of this, although everyone was like brothers,
I didn't let them know too much. Only Chiến and I knew everyone's names
and addresses. There were two people who were very close friends, but they
only discovered they were in the same organization when they boarded the boat.

Chiến returned from Phước Hòa to say everything was smooth and we
could start as planned. The departure date was set for May 7, 1978.

I chose six strong young men to go down to the forest ahead on Labor Day,
May 1, one day after the tragic date of April 30, 1978—the day of mourning
for the regime. I remembered Hoàng Hải Thủy, a renowned writer who had
been jailed by the state for reactionary thoughts three months prior. In a
poem he wrote, there was a line:

*Every five years when the tragic day comes*
*We light incense in our hearts to remember and mourn.*

Now he was being held in solitary confinement, denied contact with his wife and
children. Would he have the chance to quiet his heart and mourn what was lost?

I, a younger brother by exactly one twelve-year cycle, had been advised by him:

"If you can leave, go. Then live like a human being."

I was trying to do exactly as he said.

At exactly 5 p.m. on May 1, six young men on our side were scattered among
the street stalls around Phú Xuân market.

At exactly 6 p.m., like a ghost, Tư Nhiễn appeared from somewhere, wearing
a conical hat, a dark blue shirt, boxer shorts, and barefoot. I calmly paid
for my limeade and walked out parallel to him. He whispered:

"Don't go down near the warehouse, there's a militia boat. We have to go
down near the bridge foot..."

I told him:

"Alright. The first wave, three guys, go down with you first. Tell Cang to
come pick me up for the second wave. I'll wait here."

Tư Nhiễn nodded and turned away. Seeing my signal, three young men cut
across the asphalt road to follow him. Two minutes later, they vanished
under the bridge abutment. I carefully walked up onto the bridge to
monitor. The small boat began to turn. Tư Nhiễn stood at the bow, then
the stern. Điển, now wearing only boxer shorts, tried his best to row. A
skilled photographer by trade, Điển had volunteered for the first trip
and adapted to the circumstances very quickly. His clothes were tattered
and faded; he squatted and bobbed, wiggling the oar like anyone else.

I turned back to the old spot, reassured. There was a bus from Phú Xuân to
central Saigon, but it stopped running at 6 p.m. I waited for Cang until 6:30,
my heart pounding. The other three men knew nothing, ordering another bowl or
two of mung bean sweet soup at the nearby stalls. The sky grew dark. 7 p.m.,
still no sign. 8:30 p.m., Cang was still missing. What was happening? Caught
by the police? Unreasonable, because with the bustling scene of firewood
boats like this, the police couldn't possibly detect my group. Why hadn't
Cang come up to get me? I took a risk, searching among the bobbing boats
on the night water. No sign of Tư Nhiễn and his son. The sky had just
fallen, but it was pitch black because it was the end of the lunar month. I
felt like I was going mad, my body burning hot. How could this happen? What
happened? Disregarding security, I stood on a plank jutting out and called
out loudly, "Brother Nhiễn! Cang!" A few heads poked out from the holds
of nearby boats and looked up, but no one answered. The water surface still
churned with boats, but my flotilla had vanished without a trace. I checked
my watch: 8:30 p.m. So be it.

I went back to Phú Xuân market and ordered the three waiting men to go
home. They looked bewildered. I whispered:

"Rest assured, it will be resolved later. Now, go home."

"But there are no more buses."

"Then walk."

I let two of them go ahead. Once they were out of sight, the other man and
I set off. My legs were heavy as lead, my head spun, my eyes blurred, but
I tried to appear calm so the others wouldn't be afraid.

According to the plan, the five boats were to carry seven people past the Nhà
Bè river junction to Tắc Ông Mai, where Chánh and Thái were waiting
with another boat and two others. That boat would tow the five small boats
just like any other group of boats going down to the forest to cut wood. Tư
Nhiễn hadn't met Thái. Thái didn't know Tư Nhiễn either. They were
all waiting for me while I dragged my feet on the road. What would happen
now? I walked blindly, my heart tangled like a mess of thread. Was Heaven
punishing us?

Today was Labor Day, so occasionally we passed groups of people forced to
enjoy "mass culture" performances on makeshift stages by the roadside. Even
though I didn't want to listen, the shrill singing still pierced my ears:

"...Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh..."

as if those two words displayed the same image. Uncle Ho was being deified
at all costs. Children sang: "Last night I dreamed of meeting Uncle Ho... Who
loves Uncle Ho Chi Minh more than us children?"

In the press, the front page always had to have his picture—sometimes hugging
a female anti-American hero, sometimes fondling a labor hero, sometimes
wearing wooden clogs watering a star apple tree, sometimes holding a baton
conducting a symphony orchestra... His words were the Bible, framed everywhere,
including words he mimicked from the ancients or stole from old books... It
was obnoxious to the point where a certain city resident had to say:

"One day without seeing Uncle's picture, without reading Uncle's words, I
can't eat, can't sleep, can't relieve myself, speak incoherently, and when
I look in the mirror, I see a detestable face."

I laughed out loud at the story of some Southern children comparing Uncle Ho to
their idol when they saw him waving his baton conducting an orchestra. "Seeing
Uncle Ho is like the Monkey King, Sun Wukong, wielding his magic staff and
dancing wildly." Even if called the Great Sage Equal to Heaven, in reality,
he was still just a monkey.

We finally managed the 13 kilometers back to the Saigon border at 11
p.m. Despite it being a major holiday and the curfew being lifted, the streets
were completely empty, with no shops and no pedestrians. My Saigon was dying
in the cradle of the regime.

All the next day, I ran hither and thither, searching for Tư Nhiễn and
the boat fleet until I finally caught him at dusk. I looked terrible,
but he looked even worse. His eyes were dull, his face yellow, his
cheekbones protruding. After just 24 hours, he seemed to have withered away
completely. The story gradually became clear.

His nerves were so strained that after taking the three people down, he went
straight across the Nhà Bè junction to Tắc Ông Mai. After anchoring the
boats, he remembered he had to pick up another group. He and Cang returned to
Phú Xuân, but it was already late. What could be done? Everyone was scared,
not just him. I tried to reassure him, asked the other three to temporarily
go back, and notified Chiến that there was a glitch.

Right at that moment, the state delivered a fatal blow to the masses: Currency
Exchange! Each person could exchange 50 đồng. A family could not exchange
more than 500 đồng. Anyone with more than the regulation amount had to
deposit it in the state bank. The people all knew that money deposited in
the state bank was as good as lost. They had experienced it once before. To
withdraw money from the bank, one had to submit an application stating the
reason and wait for the state to review it. Someone asked to withdraw money
to bury his father, but it wasn't until after the first death anniversary
that the cadre called him up to lecture him that he shouldn't waste money on
funerals, only use money for production. Of course, there was no withdrawing
money. That absurd story happened in Vietnam just like any other absurd
story—absurd to the point of disbelief, yet it still happened. Because of
the currency exchange, a curfew was imposed all day on May 3, 1978.

I was discouraged. Was there no way left? That night, Chiến suddenly
returned from Phước Hòa. The two of us looked at each other. Could we
have lost? Give up? No way. Chiến and I decided to be bold. Leave right
from Saigon, no more waiting.

The meeting was convened on the morning of May 4, including Tư Nhiễn,
Thái, and Chánh to facilitate coordination. A plan was formed in a flash,
full of daring. We would go in small groups of two to four people, boarding
the boats right in Saigon.

The first four people, who had missed the trip before, volunteered. I, Thái,
Chánh, and Điển risked our lives carrying the boat and transporting
oil down to the sampans docked at Cầu Hàng. On the first day alone, 300
liters got through safely. Thank goodness, the first trip was done, and the
flotilla dropped off the people and buried the oil at the designated spot,
returning on May 6. They left one boat with Tư Nhiễn's eldest son. The
second wave started immediately. At dusk on May 6, only Nguyễn Phúc was
picked up, while Hoài and chị Nhung were arrested. This incident made me
dare not be reckless anymore; I temporarily halted the oil transport.

At dawn on May 7, four more people went down to the boats to meet and go to
the forest with anh Phúc. They would meet Mr. Thông’s large boat on the
other side of the Phú Xuân creek. Nearly half the people had truly left
their families, stepping into the adventure. I had watched them step down
into the boats with worry. I prayed.

When faith is threatened with total extermination by violence, it flares up
intensely. I was born into a Buddhist family but had never gone to the temple
and always looked at monks with half an eye. But this time, I prayed with
all my sincerity. I did not pray for myself. I hoped for peace for my friends.

Among those reluctant woodcutters were Mr. Thông’s two daughters. They
were university students but decided to drop out when called to attend
political supplementary education. A person with a normal mind who knows
how to eat and sleep, knows right from wrong, would go crazy listening to
the political lectures of state cadres. Everything was distorted to the
utmost. History was twisted, religion was smeared, philosophy was bent,
all to lead to one conclusion: "We must serve the regime without thinking,
without condition. We must bow our heads and labor without reasoning because
the Party takes care of all thinking." When people teach math to children by
adding up corpses, one must consider the gun as everything. "One soldier in
the morning kills 8 puppets, in the afternoon shoots 6 others. Ask, how many
puppets went to their doom?"
