**Setting Sail**

The sea breeze was sweet. The air smelled fresh. The sky was brightening. I
looked back; Vũng Tàu sparkled in the distance. "That's Vũng Tàu,
my friend; you've only escaped when you can't see it anymore." Farewell,
Vietnam. Farewell, homeland, motherland, fatherland. Farewell, Vũng Tàu,
Front Beach, Back Beach, Ô Quắn, Roche Noir, the golden sand beach, and
the images of long-ago days spent lying in the sun. The sea was a pale blue.

The waves were larger than the boat. Anh Bé said to me:

"If our lot isn't to beg for mercy, we can say we've escaped."

From the back, Thái crawled over. He told me: "Thank you." Hiệu, though
green and wilted, added: "I can smell freedom already. Thank you so much. Well
done." Anh Bé also expressed: "Naturally, it's well done."

I smiled. Too tired. "Let me into the cabin to lie down a bit." Chiến
helped me lean back, and I fell asleep amidst the fierce waves.

The pungent smell seeping into my nostrils woke me. Anh Tám was speaking
loudly: "The cabin is for women and children. Men go down to the holds to
lie down." I sat up. Around me were haggard faces, disheveled clothes, and
tousled hair. The boat was still being tossed violently. White-capped waves
swept over the deck; everyone was soaking wet. Exhausted, I tried to crawl
out. Thái, Nam, and Chánh were passing the children one by one to lean
against the cabin, the relatively safest spot. It was a hold nearly two
meters wide and three meters long. My neck hurt, my legs were giving out,
my arms didn't want to lift. Mr. Thông lay nearby, dozing. Chị Điển and
Chị Chiến were helped in. Then the children—Bi, Ti—and the girls Oanh,
Ánh Mai... Everyone nodded at me. I nodded back and crawled outside to ask:

"Where's Anh Phúc? Where's Điển?"

"Passed out. Vomiting green and yellow bile."

A light rain fell, shivering cold. I asked Anh Bé: "Are we far yet?"

"Not far enough, but don't worry. In seas like this, there isn't a soul
around to fear. I estimate the waves are Force 7."

"So, a storm?"

"A small storm."

Groping my way forward, I looked into each hold. My brothers, my friends
were all there. Though seasick and dizzy, they all smiled at me. The Vomitop
seasickness pills were useless. Reaching the bow hold, I looked in. Anh
Phúc and Bằng lay curled up.

"How are you?"

"Surviving like this is a miracle."

"Indeed, a miracle."

"Hey, why don't you praise me for being good?"

"Of course you're good, but it's truly a miracle. There is Heaven. There
is Heaven."

Once everyone was settled with a place to sit, I looked for Chánh.

"Rice, water situation?"

"Indochinese tragedy. Waves knocked over a water jar. Another jar tilted,
spilling half. The food left on the small boat is half gone. Crushed noodles,
dried bread couldn't be brought. Milk is sufficient."

"Why?"

"Chiến urged us too much, everyone lost their heads. Just getting the
women and children up took everything we had. What can be done now?"

I called Thái up to discuss. We decided to limit food and drink
immediately. Thái smiled: "Don't worry. No one can eat yet. Vomiting
everywhere. It's raining, so no one is drinking water."

Just then, Chiến shouted from the rear: "Military boat!"

To our left, a boat bobbed, crossing our path. I asked Anh Bé: "Is it them?"

"Maybe. If it were a fishing boat, they wouldn't be out working in seas like
this. If they were already at sea, they'd be heading into shore. Don't be
afraid, it's too far away to catch us. It moves about the same speed as us."

Everyone silently watched the adversary also bobbing up and down among the
white-capped waves. What if they intercepted us? I pushed the thought away
and, as Anh Bé predicted, the distance between us remained constant. Over
an hour later, the enemy vessel turned another way.

The sea remained fierce. Tư Nhiễn came to ask if I wanted to eat; I shook
my head. Rain still fell, everyone wet as drowned rats. Moving on the boat
was extremely dangerous as it tossed beyond imagination. Crawling to the bow,
I was thrown into the sea by a wave. Luckily, I was cautious and grabbed a
rope, so I was pulled up. There were cases where people fell overboard and
were left behind because they couldn't be rescued in time. I crawled into
the forward hold and curled up with Anh Phúc, Bằng, and Nam. Perhaps from
exhaustion, I drifted into a light, floating sleep.

The next morning, the rain stopped, but it was still overcast. Everyone
seemed used to the sea, much more alert. Anh Bé said we would have to head
inside Côn Sơn island. Yesterday's rough seas made him dare not go far out
as planned, circling outside the island. He had to choose a route close to
the coast, which meant the danger of being intercepted by enemy ships still
remained. Perhaps because of the vast expanse of sky and water, no one paid
attention to Anh Bé's warning, but there was trouble with something else. The
water pump was broken because the dynamo was soaked with seawater and no
longer worked. I assigned buckets for bailing. This was hard work because the
engine room was hot, slippery, and cramped. Two people per shift. We bailed
day and night. The boat ran well. Everyone was happy. A little boy asked me:

"When will we get there, Uncle?"

"Soon, hang in there."

"I'm hungry."

"Eat a little or you'll vomit and be very tired."

"I'm not vomiting anymore. I'm hungry."

"You'll vomit again soon. Tomorrow Uncle will take you to eat phở."

The boy looked at me doubtfully. Suddenly, I craved phở unbearably. Bà
Dậu's phở with clear broth and soft meat, without a hint of beef smell. Gia
Long phở, clear but sweet. Tàu Bay phở, rich and spicy. Phở Number
One of the Fat Lady, strong with the scent of radish. Pasteur phở with
the rare "tái sữa" cut. Cao Vân phở, never could finish a bowl. Oh,
Phở. Oh, Vietnam. I missed it the moment I left. I looked at the boy,
my heart softening:

"Go find Anh Thái and ask him to mix a glass of milk. Remember to say Uncle
Thiệp gave permission." I knew Thái was principled, never giving more
than the ration to anyone, so I had to instruct the boy carefully.

The boat still plunged through the vast ocean. Everyone gradually revived. Anh
Phúc, though a man of few words, laughed and asked me this and that. People
still took turns bailing water in the hold. The quietest now was Tư
Nhiễn. He asked me:

"Can we go back, sir? I miss Vietnam so much!"

"We'll go back. But where have we reached to go back? Calm down, Anh Tư."

The boat still dove deep then surged high. Sometimes I thought it would
flip. Anh Bé said he had turned the boat to go around the outside of Côn
Sơn. According to him, going this way only meant dealing with wind and waves,
less fear of interception. He told me:

"Anyway, we're out here now, can't retreat. If I were a captain like in the
old days, I wouldn't dare take a ship out in times like this. But now it's
different. Better to die in the middle of the sea."

"Agreed with you from the start."

Shivering cold. Soaking wet, we looked for places that seemed drier. The
needle indicating the engine's revolution was still active, the engine still
cracked sharply, but the boat wasn't moving. Chiến stopped the engine to
check. Thái jumped into the water and surfaced to say the propeller had fallen
off. Everyone looked at each other in surprise. I remembered clearly buying
this propeller with Thái from some Chợ Lớn Chinese men about two weeks
before leaving. Chiến had said the old propeller was only about 54 cm wide,
making the boat run weakly, so he suggested buying a bigger one. The two of
us sneaked around all afternoon to find a 64 cm one, at a terrible price: 240
đồng. The heavy brass propeller, I couldn't lift it alone, yet it could
fall off. Nam jumped down to check again, and the next news was even more
tragic. The propeller was lost. It was too dark, so we anchored. Luckily,
the waves lessened. We lay sprawled on the boat seats, not knowing what the
future held. Perhaps too tired, no one bothered to think, just fell asleep.

Morning, the sun rose early. Chiến luckily still had the old propeller in the
engine room. We tried to fit it, but no screw fit the shaft. Anh Tư Nhiễn
disassembled parts of the broken machine, found a slightly wide screw. We
decided to fit it and tie it with lead wire. In the history of boating,
surely only our boat ran with a propeller assembled so makeshift. When the
engine started, everyone waited anxiously. The boat moved forward and sped
up. Surprisingly, it worked.

Rain fell again with a low, gloomy sky. Shivering cold. The children's lips
were pale, my heart sank. All the raincoats had been lost. Everything was
soaked, but by evening the sky gradually cleared. High up, stars twinkled.

"There are lights, a ship."

From far away on the horizon, we saw two spots of light. We discussed and
decided to light the emergency lights. The electrical system on the boat was
ruined by seawater. We lit torches and waved frantically, using a blanket
to play "Red Indian" and signal SOS. The two lights grew clearer. Everyone
cheered. These were probably two fishing boats traveling together. They
approached us, splitting up to flank us on either side. Everyone rushed out
joyfully, shouting. We saw sailors on board. But the joy didn't last. They
slowly cut through the waves and left. Anh Bé told me:

"I hope we're on the right course for the Malay Peninsula. We'll see many
more ships."

Just as we got over the disappointment, Thái reported even sadder news. Water
and food, though limited to the max, were now in full alarm. I regretted the
food left behind, terribly. Had to limit even more. Drinking water, each person
was allowed one capful per time, three times a day. No exceptions. Calculating
that, each person got only about 15cc of water and a ball of rice the size
of a tangerine in a day. Poor children.

"I'm hungry."

"I'm thirsty."

"Is there milk, Uncle?"

I joked to make them happy. I promised nonsense. I soothed and comforted. But
they only forgot for a moment then asked again. What could I do? The adults
didn't complain. I crawled into the small hold at the bow to pray.

The sun rose higher. By noon, we were sweating profusely. The sun shone
brilliantly. We took turns scooping seawater to pour on the deck to cool
down. I shouted at the boys, forcing them to crawl inside to save energy,
but they complained it was suffocating inside. We had encountered, seen,
near and far, 13 large ships. They paid us no heed, casually going their
way. Thái told me he just re-checked. 12 liters of water left. I didn't
know what to say. Just then, around 3 p.m., a shout from the rear:

"Ship!"

I looked at the ship's silhouette in the distance, my heart unmoved. Hard
to force them to stop. Anh Bé observed then said:

"It's going the same direction as us. Let me intercept."

He turned the boat in a circle before the large ship's path. It
stopped. Everyone cheered wildly. Anh Bé pulled alongside. Everyone
had revived. Anh Phúc and Anh Bé would go up to "negotiate." Sailors
and passengers came out to look at us curiously. We saw the ship's name:
*MANOZ PUSAN*, A, Korean ship. Our side. But even if they were our side,
they absolutely wouldn't let Anh Phúc up. When he grabbed the iron ladder,
climbing near the deck, they put out their foot signaling if he came up
further, they'd kick him down. We shouted:

"Water, water."

They threw down a fresh water hose. We brought out all the containers to
fill. We needed more fuel because the boat currently only had about 100
liters. Many loud shouts:

"Gasoline."

Nghi carried the empty tank to signal. Anh Phúc still refused to come down. He
hung on the ladder like a frog, clothes soaking wet. I heard him shout:

"We come in peace."

Among the well-dressed Koreans, I saw a young woman looking down at us in
surprised curiosity. Anh Phúc still shouted. His voice sounded lost. The
captain waved to Nghi. Quick as a flash, Nghi tied 4 cans to a rope for the
*MANOZ* sailors to pull up. A moment later, they lowered two 40-liter cans
and signaled that was all. They determinedly waved Anh Phúc away. Anh Bé,
thinking of the voyage, tied a map the size of a hand, torn from a large map,
asking the captain to confirm the position. Seeing the small children on our
boat, a few sailors ran inside. A moment later, they came out and threw down
a box of powdered milk. Many others threw down instant noodle packets. The
captain signaled to Anh Phúc that if he didn't get off the ladder, they
would kick him. He had to climb down. The bulky iron ship slowly cut through
the waves, leaving behind 48 souls drifting in a tiny boat. They were all
heading towards Singapore.

Taking stock, we "begged" 40 packs of noodles, water, and 40 liters
of fuel. Besides that, we knew we were still 360 nautical miles from
Singapore. Happy, but the joy didn't last when re-examining the fuel we
currently had. I told Thái to continue keeping food and water rations at
the lowest level because we didn't know how long we'd drift.

The night was beautiful. Dim moonlight but a clear sky. The sea surface
was like a flat mirror. Everyone looked around. The majestic scenery of the
ocean made us tremble with fear. Anh Bé predicted:

"All my life at sea, I've never seen a sea as calm as tonight. Experience
shows the sea might be rough and stormy tomorrow. I fear a big storm."

Everyone looked at each other worriedly. True to Anh Bé's word, rain fell at
dawn. The sky was covered with low black clouds, seemingly within reach. Waves
hit as if to break the boat. Just then, a major accident occurred. The engine
stopped. We looked at each other, no one said a word. Anchor down. The nearly
200-meter anchor line was let out. I called Chánh over:

"I checked carefully. Our air starter tank only has 12 kilos of pressure
left. Needs at least 16 kilos to start."

"Any other way?"

"With the current condition. No."

Chiến, Nghi, Thái, Anh Bé, and even Tư Nhiễn looked at me as if I
could perform a miracle. I calmly announced:

"Find a place you can crawl into and sleep. Lie down to regain strength. Rarely
do we get to sleep in the middle of a storm. Standing here is cold, your
lungs will get inflamed."

Not a word of protest. I crawled back to the bow hold and squeezed in. Bằng
and Anh Phúc looked at me.

"No way out. Go to sleep, gentlemen."

I curled up like a shrimp against the hull, legs propped on the other
side. The bow hold was too narrow, so the three of us had to lie in that
weird posture from the first day. My hip pressed against the wood edge,
hurting gradually. My tailbone felt a heavy blow, stinging with pain. Is this
the end for the Lê family? I lay still, eyes wide open. Rainwater trickled
onto my head and neck. Anh Phúc was also silent. Tư Nhiễn poked his
head down. I grinned, trying to smile at him. He didn't smile. He dropped
down. The three of us squeezed together to make room for him. He pulled out
a cigarette. Lit it amidst everyone's surprise. We had run out of cigarettes
yesterday. The cigarettes brought, though wrapped carefully in nylon, were
soaking wet. Passing the cigarette around, we smoked silently. Anh Tư asked:

"Are we still far from shore?"

"Close to dropping dead."

Anh Tư didn't ask more. He seemed to know the shore was still too far,
the boat was still being tossed by waves. I heard the waves hitting the hull
loudly, my heart aching for the fragile wooden planks. Thái crawled over and
gave each person a piece of sticky rice cake half the size of a cigarette
pack. That was the ration for the whole day. We nibbled slowly, thinking
vaguely. I turned to ask Anh Phúc, "How is Brandy different from Cognac?" He
explained thoroughly which Whisky was good. He said Chivas Regal. Originally
a university professor, having held many important positions, he showed
he understood the etiquette and customs of countries around the world very
well. "German beer with hot sausage is the best. Eat fish, must drink white
wine." We were pretending to forget the reality. "Actually, London is very
boring. Paris is fun but needs a lot of money. But in Holland, looks that
way but it's good. People here are gentle, flowers beautiful and plentiful,
climate pleasant. Northern Europe? Sweden is very advanced..." And so, we
talked about places where probably no one at this hour could imagine our
circumstances. Anh Tư also listened silently to the random stories.

Past noon, the rain stopped, but waves were still large. Walls of water
larger than the boat tossed us high and plunged us low. I crawled to the
rear. Everyone shivered from cold and hunger. I gritted my teeth and told Thái
to mix milk for the kids. Nghi and Chiến found me to suggest heating the
engine's air tank; the pressure would increase. Agreed immediately. Everyone
gathered to stoke the fire. I looked at the gauge; it only showed 8 kilos
after 2 hours of heating. Pressure crept up to 9 kilos and then didn't
rise. Another suggestion was made. Thái disabled one cylinder, letting
only one piston work. Do it immediately. Like that, we tried to turn things
around. The engine sat silent, still. Hand crank it? Let's try, brothers. Nghi,
Nam, and Anh Tư Nhiễn, the three strongest, rolled up their sleeves. They
cranked like mad but couldn't overcome the minimum torque needed to engage
the flywheel. Their hands were raw. Chánh came close to me and whispered:

"I'm not being pessimistic, but this engine can't be hand-cranked. You see,
when manufactured, the engineer didn't make a spot for cranking. Don't
waste energy."

I told everyone to stop. "Go to sleep, folks." The three "warriors," being
too tired, were allowed to eat a pack of noodles and drink half a glass of
milk. Anh Tư couldn't bear to eat alone, hesitated looking at the precious
food then called Cang over, gave it all. Cang looked at his dad and shook
his head. On the roof, a shout: "Ship."

Hiệu and Anh Tám, on rescue duty, waved frantically. An SOS sign had been
made, but the ship, like the others, casually left. I climbed to the roof
and asked Hiệu:

"How many have rejected us now?"

"Stopped counting. Us Vietnamese are truly unwanted lepers, total outcasts,
nobody wants to get involved."

Darkness fell. Everyone was miserable. Đàn, Tùng, Thịnh didn't complain
a word, but clearly they were starving. I soothed, comforted them, and
assigned bailing duties. Anh Tám and Hiệu stayed awake all night to call
for help if they saw a ship. The children seemed to go limp from hunger. The
two smallest, Chiến's and Điển's, cried constantly. One of Anh Bé's
children passed out despite having drunk a special glass of milk. Too tired,
I crawled into the cramped hole with Anh Phúc and Bằng, who had gone limp
in the curled position, ears hearing the waves hitting the hull noisily.
