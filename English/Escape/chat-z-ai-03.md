**The Rendezvous**

The bus reached the station, but I sat there numbly, startled only when the
conductor reminded me, "We're at the station, sir!" Phú Xuân was bustling
at this hour, with fishing boats bringing back their catch and firewood
boats preparing to ride the ebb tide. I went into a shop and ordered a
bowl of *bún*. I had just lifted my spoon when Chị Lan walked in with
two children. Turning around, I saw Chị Nhung, disheveled and carrying
a baby, asking her little sister what she wanted to eat. Looking out the
door, I saw Chị Điển standing across the street holding her child, and
Anh Hoài was also about to step in. I shook my head, and they understood,
moving diagonally away to another spot. I looked anxiously at the policeman
standing idly in front of the People's Police station. This was too much.

I had told them over and over last night to sit near the bus station, so why
were they all crammed into a place riddled with police? I silently continued
eating my noodles. The police station across the way had peeling whitewashed
walls and mossy black roof tiles, exuding an aura of death. Policemen in
boxer shorts held enamel mugs, running back and forth, seemingly going to
brush their teeth or looking for hot water to make coffee. The barbed-wire
fence remained as it had been for ages. It was truly convenient. The regime
had fully inherited the old facilities of the "puppets," and I was reminded
of Du Fu:

*Lâu đài đệ trạch giai tân chủ*
*Văn vũ y quan dị tích thì*

*Palaces and mansions all have new masters,*
*Civil and military officials dress differently from times past.*

But Du Fu, though a literary giant, was perhaps of less use to me at this
moment than Tư Nhiễn. He walked sluggishly into the shop, pulled up a chair,
and ordered a glass of iced water. After drinking, he walked out casually,
blending into the market crowd. I called for the check and followed him.

"Is it done?"

"Done. The boat is under the bridge. Wait for me to buy some food first."

The two of us, like a couple, haggled and carried a bundle of vegetables
and tomatoes out of the market. I jerked my head as a signal. Chị Lan,
Chị Chiến, and Chị Điển filed out one after another like they were
going to a festival.

Facing that situation, Tư Nhiễn quick-wittedly babbled:

"Ha, we're going to visit Uncle Tư, okay?" And he offered his muscular arm
to pick up Anh Chiến's child.

"Smile now. Going down to the boat to Uncle Tư's house for fish rice, okay?"

The little boy grinned wide. I led Chị Lan's child while Anh Hoài carried
Anh Điển's child. I also feigned nonchalance:

"Gosh, what a crowd. Let's buy more bread to eat with curry to make it
enough. So many people."

Anh Tám emerged from some hidden corner, nobody knew which, and chimed in:

"That's enough, Brother Sáu. Let's go, or the tide will rise and we won't
get across the creek mouth, we'll be late."

If any curious cop were around, he would have to understand we were going to
a death anniversary feast, especially since Chị Điển was holding three
sticks of incense. She said she had vowed to light incense to thank Heaven
once we reached the sea! I plunged into the water, holding the sampan close
to the bank. Anh Tám helped me get the children and the women aboard. Seeing
their clumsy movements, two or three heads popped up from nearby boats to
stare. But Tư Nhiễn was quick as a flash; as soon as the last person
was aboard, he pushed the boat off. Three minutes later, the boat drifted
slowly into the middle of the river. I stood at the bow, paddle in hand,
and paddled. From the other side of the river, two other small boats lazily
detached from the bank. Like a satellite docking in space, I snatched the
rope Cang threw to me and held tight. Cang slipped inside, started the F-4
engine, and we shot out into the big river.

I felt light. I counted. Good heavens. Eleven souls, young and old, on a tiny
sampan. Bằng, Tùng, Bình, and the little girl Oanh poked their heads out
and grinned at me. I smiled back, but my heart was not at peace. There were
still too many uncertainties ahead. According to plan, Thái and Chính's
boat wouldn't meet us until 5 p.m. at the Đồng Tranh junction. We were
leaving early because the boats were too small to cross the Phú Xuân creek
mouth against the tide. I asked Tư Nhiễn:

"What do we do from now until 5 p.m.?"
He laughed:
"Well, we're going to a death anniversary, aren't we? Don't worry."

At 10 a.m., our three boats pulled into the riverbank near a field. There
was an abandoned thatched hut there. Perhaps a family had come here to farm,
to engage in direct production, but couldn't stand the hunger and sold
everything to return to the city. No one was surprised by such things anymore.

When the troops stumbled into Saigon, no matter what, the Vietnamese people
breathed a sigh of relief: "That's the end of the gunfire!" They thought of
a peaceful future. The state tirelessly promoted the idea of the fields,
of direct production, of building the country. It was very reasonable,
especially for those who had fled to the city to escape the bombs. Many
families in the city sold their houses and possessions to gather capital
and return to the countryside.

Reality turned against their humble dream. Seeds were impossible to
buy. Official fertilizer didn't exist; buying it outside cost ten times the
price. The regime knew nothing but measuring land and levying taxes. Without
support from the Party and state, and battered by three consecutive years of
natural disasters—sometimes drought, sometimes floods—they had no food,
no clothes, no medicine when sick, and education was a distant story. They
had to return to the city, regardless of the consequences. These victims
became people living on the margins of society for lack of legal residence
papers. Having no homes, they slept on sidewalks and streets. Not allowed to
buy food, they had to scrape by, meal to meal. Originally honest and simple
people, they were pushed by the regime into a life outside the law, becoming
dishonest, stealing for a living. Saigon was overflowing with people sleeping
on the streets. Every night, people slept in rows at the train station,
along Lê Thánh Tôn, Gia Long, Công Lý, Tự Do streets... Occasionally,
the police would stage a raid, bring trucks to scoop them up and toss them
into some remote area for "direct production." But they escaped back to Saigon
because only here, despite the hunger, they wouldn't die. They weren't afraid
because they had nothing left to preserve. They were like wild beasts now,
empty stomachs, just hoping for something to stuff into their flat bellies.

We went into the empty hut to cook rice. I asked Tư Nhiễn and Bằng
to light the fire, asked Chị Lan and Chị Điển to clean the hut, and
I went around back to look. Cogon grass grew thick over a large area. Not
a soul in sight, just a few white storks circling back and forth. I felt
temporarily reassured and went back in. Tư Nhiễn seemed to have regained
his old spirit, joking happily with the children. He took them to catch
fiddler crabs and bathe in the river. Their innocent faces lit up with
delight. Everything was new to them.

"What's this, Uncle Thiệp?"
"A crab."
"Wrong. Uncle Tư says it's a fiddler crab."
"What's the difference between a fiddler crab and a crab?"
"Fiddler crabs are small, crabs are big."
"This one is big, so why is it a fiddler crab?"
"Don't drive your uncle crazy, kids."

Little Tí ran to tell his mother:
"Uncle Thiệp doesn't know anything at all."

I looked at Oanh and shook my head. She smiled and asked:
"Why are you shaking your head, Uncle?"
"You're too pale. You're so pretty, if the police ask, I won't know what to
say. Going to a death anniversary, why are we groping around here?"

Tư Nhiễn looked at me and scowled:
"Why are you afraid of everything? If they ask, we say we're going to Phước
Hòa, the tide is high now so we have to pull into the bank to wait for the
ebb. What's there to be afraid of? I'm not afraid anymore."

Honestly, I didn't know what I would do if we ran into militia. Every boat
looked like an enemy boat. That morning, an army patrol boat had glided past
us, looked around, then left, stopping everyone's heart. Oh well. The sun
grew fainter. A kingfisher perched on a date palm, tilting its head to watch
the river, waiting, then like an arrow, it dived into the rippling water. The
scene was peaceful, but my soul was restless. Tư Nhiễn thought ahead and
cooked a large pot of rice, but at that moment, no one ate a bite. We were
anxious about Thái's boat. At five o'clock, again it was Tư Nhiễn who
spotted it first when the boat was still a kilometer away. He whispered:
"It's here!"

We scattered into three boats and detached from the bank. Half an hour later,
another docking operation took place on the river. This month, it got dark
early. Within half an hour, we couldn't see each other's faces clearly. We
transferred all the women and children to the large boat so they could lie
in the covered hold. I also jumped over to the large boat to meet Mr. Thông
and Anh Bé. Mr. Thông recounted:
"In Phú Xuân, we were really stuck. We couldn't go down to the boat dock
because it was too dangerous. We had to go down at the market pier. Good
heavens, do you think fifteen people, big and small, lining up and climbing
down into a boat is scary? Surely something blinded them, or the whole bunch
of us would be dead."

I said:
"We're doing this entirely based on the element of surprise. The secret
police don't think we'd just sail out to sea right in front of them. That
part is over, but there's still the time from now until night."

I outlined the plan. Arrive at Bàn Thạch intersection at 10 p.m. Pick up
the group in the forest and dig up the oil. Go out to the Golden Sandbar at 1
a.m. to meet Chiến. Chiến promised to wait at most until 3 a.m. Mr. Thông
asked:
"What if we go out and don't meet Anh Chiến?"
"Then we go back. Don't be afraid."

Mr. Thông was afraid, surely, but he wasn't the only one. I was afraid
too, and surely everyone was. Everyone tried to make themselves small
and silent. Fishing boats at work flickered with lights. Our flotilla
towed each other along proudly like any other group of boats. The waves
whispered. Mr. Thông gave me a piece of delicious candy. He whispered:
"Leftover old candy, I've been saving it."

At the big river bend leading into Bàn Thạch intersection, the wind rose
fiercely, and waves rocked the small boats as if to capsize them. A leaf
hat was blown into the river, almost sweeping two shivering people away with
it. Chị Điển's little boy cried out loudly. The children had been given
Phenergan mixed in milk and half a tablet of Valium. He should have been
sound asleep; I don't know what he dreamed of to make him cry. I threatened
Chị Điển:
"You settle him down. If he cries later when we get to the dangerous spot,
I'll throw both mother and child into the river."

Chị Điển silently soothed the child. When we reached the rendezvous
point at a Bàn Thạch intersection, the flotilla anchored. Tư Nhiễn
and I took a small boat to pick up the others. They were deep in a small
creek. Late at night, firewood boats lay silent on both banks. Occasionally,
a dry cough echoed from inside a boat. Tư Nhiễn and I tried to row as
softly as possible. Going deep into the creek, the water was shallow, the
boat couldn't go further. Tư Nhiễn stopped rowing. He observed silently,
then whispered to me:
"This is the creek. The date palm over there. Where are they?"

I looked at him worriedly. Rừng Sát had a thousand faces. At high tide,
there was water everywhere; at low tide, mud banks emerged, the river
half-empty. The terrain was never the same twice. Had Tư Nhiễn made a
mistake? Silence around me. The air felt threatening. The date palms were
black in the silent night. Tư Nhiễn stuck the oar into the mud and tied the
boat. I understood immediately and went ashore with him. Mud up to the thighs,
very hard to walk. We splashed and waded. Where were my friends? After half
an hour, I was out of breath. Tư Nhiễn had waded up to a higher spot to
find me. I didn't know what to do anymore.

"Ò... ò... ò..."

I recognized Tư Nhiễn's voice immediately and tried to listen for
a reply. His hooting voice boomed, going deep and far, but there was no
reply. I continued splashing, soft mud covering my body; I fell and got up,
shivering with cold. Could they have been caught? If so, and I stumbled
in, it would be hard to escape. My heart was a tangle of threads. I felt
abandoned in the dark night. I heard another hoot. No answer. A moment later,
I heard Tư Nhiễn shout loudly: "Liễng... ời..." I burst out laughing,
though there was nothing funny in this situation. I remembered the time I was
left behind at Phú Xuân and shouted just like Tư Nhiễn. So, caution was
thrown to the wind. I thought for a moment, then turned back to the boat. So
be it. Tư Nhiễn also returned. We looked at each other worriedly. I asked:
"Are you sure about this creek?"
"Sure! I know this place like my own house."
"They must understand that we're picking them up tonight. When the tide is
low, they should row out to the creek mouth. Very strange."

I decided to go back and meet Thái. Thái said the militia had just
questioned them. My heart stopped when I didn't see the F-4 boat, and I
shook my head. Thái told me that because Tư Nhiễn and I had been gone
so long, Cang and Anh Tâm had gone to pick up the others. They thought we
were in trouble.
"And the militia didn't search the boat?"
"Luckily, they looked into the small boat and saw two people bailing water,
so they didn't search."

Thái jumped into my boat, and we decided to dig up the oil first and calculate
later. The water was rising. I looked. Nearly one a.m. Chiến might have
already gone to the rendezvous point. We started the long-tail motor and
pulled the throttle full. The explosion roared in the late night. Arriving
at the bush marking the oil, we looked. Empty. Tư Nhiễn and I jumped
down to grope and found it immediately. Overjoyed, forgetting the cold,
I bobbed up and down digging out each can of oil buried in the mud. Thái
stood on the boat, constantly urging me. When the last can was up, I covered
the whole boat with a sedge mat and returned. With the oil, I was temporarily
relieved on one front, and when we got back, I saw the F-4 boat tied alongside
Mr. Thông's boat. Điển poked his head out from the camouflaging board,
looked at me, and whispered:
"Nice work."
I smiled back. "Still tough."

It was now two a.m. I ordered the anchor raised. The tide was rising, so we
went against the waves. Even though Thái pulled the throttle full, I still
felt slow. The remaining distance, even fast, took 45 minutes. Seeing me
shivering, Tư Nhiễn handed me a lit pipe. The smoke was bitter but warmed
me. I silently drew long puffs, my mind blank. Chị Điển's little boy
screamed, but the scream was cut short. Surely he was gagged. I remembered
stories that made me shudder. There were leaders who gritted their teeth and
strangled babies to death in front of the mother. For the safety of the whole
group, the mother had to watch her child die without a complaint. Would I dare?

Tư Nhiễn whistled at me and whispered, "Saw it." Chiến's boat was
anchored in the middle of the junction.

Later he recounted that he had been waiting since exactly one a.m. By three
a.m., not seeing us, he was about to pull anchor when the flotilla appeared. He
said, "If you were five minutes later, I would have gone. Anchoring too long
is dangerous."

Disregarding all calculations, we pulled right up to the big boat. I,
Tư Nhiễn, and Thái handled the oil. The others handled the luggage,
bringing the women and children into the forward holds. Chiến's voice
hissed through his teeth, "Hurry up! The whole bunch will die now." Everyone
was frantic. Mrs. Thông was grabbed around the waist and shoved down the
hold. Anyone finding a spot just crawled in. Perhaps in just a few minutes,
Chiến started the engine. The boat shook violently and turned its bow toward
the mouth. I was in the engine room looking out. It was getting light. On
deck, there were only Chiến, Anh Bé, and Nghi. Everyone else sat or lay
piled on top of each other, curled up in three narrow holds.

The boat was 11 meters long and 3 meters wide, too small to carry 48
people. The smell of oil rose thick in the engine room. Engine heat radiated
fiercely. In just a moment, I was soaked in sweat. Looking to the side,
Hiệu was slumped over vomiting. Tùng and Đàn, their faces green as
banana leaves, asked me:
"Do you have any oil for motion sickness?"
I comforted them:
"Hold on! In a bit, you can go up and feel better."

The boat lunged up and down with the waves, knocking everything in the hold
askew. My stomach clenched. I tried to suppress it. Chiến looked down and
asked me:
"Is anyone missing?"
"All here. It's suffocating in here, I can't breathe."
"Try to breathe. Can't go up here. They have binoculars, seeing more than
three people on the boat is trouble."

I tried to breathe, and sweat poured out. Đàn begged:
"Let me up for just a bit. I'm about to faint."
"No."

The boat still jumped the waves, tossing us like cotton. Chiến stuck his
head down again:
"Passing the Cần Giờ lighthouse soon, this is the scariest spot. Don't
poke your heads out. The whole bunch will die."
"Rest assured, is the sea rough? Are there PCFs there?"
"No. The sea is a bit rough. It'll be calm in a bit."

Chiến lied to reassure me. The sea was violently rough that day. Normally at
the Cần Giờ lighthouse, the border police anchored a PCF—colloquially
known as a landing craft, or "open-mouthed ship." A month earlier, a group
of our friends had been intercepted and caught at this very spot. The leader
jumped into the sea to commit suicide along with the boat operator. I thought
of the Colt 45 pistol Chiến had given me. We had agreed to commit suicide if
caught. But I had thrown the gun away on Mr. Thông's advice. Experience showed
that a small gun couldn't do anything but cause trouble for others. Right
then, Chiến called down:
"Passed the lighthouse, where's the gun?"
I mumbled:
"Dropped it just now."
I heard him curse. So be it. If I had to jump into the sea, I'd die anyway. I
remembered the things that happened right here. One boat hit a reef, 34 people
died, only 4 survived. Another case, 27 people. Truly the Gate of Death. From
the engine room, I saw the flashing lighthouse. Chiến's voice echoed down:
"There's a landing craft, don't look up."

Hiệu, clutching his stomach, looked up at me. Tùng and Đàn also raised
their heads anxiously. I waved my hand. Later, reviewing the events, everyone
concluded that the enemy ship didn't bother intercepting us because the
sea was too rough. Perhaps they thought that with such a tiny boat, we were
just fish food. The boat still shook violently, lunging high then plunging
down. I was exhausted. Seeing Chiến look down, I whispered:
"Let me up or I'll die."

After thinking for a moment, he reached out to pull me up and told the other
three to come up too.
