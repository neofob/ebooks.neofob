Anh Phúc and Điển hugged two plastic drums and jumped down, swimming toward
the buoy thrown by the ship. We continued to row with determination. Seeing
me panting and dripping with sweat, Chánh suddenly realized I had been
standing and rowing for too long. Chánh said:

"Let me row. You go handle the business."

Business? What did I know how to do at this hour?

Chiến held his small child, two streams of tears flowing down his face. Oanh
sobbed, calling out, "Mommy! Mommy!" Chị Điển held her child, leaning
against the cabin wall, her face pale. Chị Lan, looking disheveled, waved
her hand. Mr. Thông affirmed, "This time, we are definitely saved!" I
nodded. Hiệu told me, "If they don't save us, I'll jump into the sea and
commit suicide. You try to escape, remember to tell everyone. I die to awaken
the conscience of those stone-hearted captains." I nodded again. Nghi and
Nam stood ready with a rope.

Anh Phúc and Điển swam with all their might. Though he jumped into the
water later, Điển arrived first. Anh Phúc seemed utterly exhausted but also
managed to reach the ladder. We saw Điển being helped up, followed by Anh
Phúc. Điển recounted later that as soon as he boarded, he could only say
one word, "Water," before fainting immediately. The sailors gave him a drink
of something he guessed was mint-flavored. He woke up instantly and requested
rescue. The captain asked if there were guns; he shook his head vigorously:

"No gun, no explosive!"

As soon as the captain agreed to rescue them, Điển "came back to life,"
running out to wave at us. Four oars were still churning the water. On the
boat, the crying sounded like a funeral, especially when Điển appeared
and raised his hand to wave. The sailors on the ship also bustled about,
running back and forth. They lowered the gangway low to wait. Gradually,
we managed to bring the boat close to the ship. Just then, Oanh fainted and
fell against me. I held the girl, looking at the scene of my boat approaching
the foot of the ladder. I shouted loudly:

"One person at a time! Help the women and children."

They showed discipline, helping each other climb slowly.

I carried Oanh on my shoulder. Upon reaching the deck, I collapsed. Everyone
was given water immediately. Perhaps Điển had spoken of our needs
beforehand. Captain Kim Do Yung personally helped me up. He asked me if it
was possible to scuttle the boat. He explained that letting it drift was very
dangerous for other ships, and besides, it was about to sink anyway. I agreed
immediately. He asked if I wanted to take anything else from the boat. I
shook my head. He personally went down to our boat, and a moment later,
came back up. The boat was pushed away. The bow pointed high into the air,
the stern sinking slowly down. The scrap of cassock serving as a yellow sail
still puffed up, stubbornly catching the wind. About five minutes later, our
beloved small boat sank deep into the heart of the ocean. We were rescued
241 nautical miles northeast of Singapore at 1:00 p.m. on May 18, 1978,
and were taken by the ship *Sun Swallow* to Chiba, Japan, seven days later,
on May 25, 1978.

**Gratitude**

The final part of this account is dedicated to thanking Captain Kim Do
Yung and the entire crew of the *Sun Swallow*. Without the chivalry of that
venerable captain and his entire crew, we would have died in the middle of
the ocean. The moment they saw us in such a wretched state at sea, they knew
we were Vietnamese fleeing Communism. They were also aware of the procedures
established by Southeast Asian nations and many other places, which would
land them in troubles sometimes costing them their jobs. Yet, they stopped
the ship to pick us up immediately after asking the company for permission.

I wish to record here the statement read by Chị Nguyễn Hữu Điển at
the farewell party the captain and crew held for us the day before we went
ashore. This also serves as the conclusion to this writing.

"... We have overcome all perils and hardships to seek Freedom. You are the
ones who helped us escape. When you stopped your ship, you surely knew the
troubles that would befall you, but out of human kindness, you allowed us
to board this *Sun Swallow*. We found Freedom from the very first moment we
set foot on this ship. Our remaining duty in the days to come is to struggle
for the freedom of our compatriots and flesh and blood currently living in
Vietnam. Whenever, wherever, we will keep this in mind and proclaim it to
our descendants..."
